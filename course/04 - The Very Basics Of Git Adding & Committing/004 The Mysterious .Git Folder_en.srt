1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,600
All right, so we just initialized our first git repository.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,280
Again, that's something we do one time per project, one time per repo.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,020
But what actually happened?

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,080
Where is the git in this folder?

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,230
Well, I'm also going to show you the docs here as a way of explaining this.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,570
If we go to the git docs, which is git zmcl, I think I've already said I never remember that I just

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,760
google git.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:32,250
And then if you go to documentation and then reference manual, you'll see some get commands including

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,710
the one we just used init right there.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,140
And then it tells us get in.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,710
It creates an empty git repository or re initialize an existing one.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,540
But we really care about that first part.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,960
And you'll notice this about the docs.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,020
They're very thorough and often can be kind of confusing at times.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,320
There's just so much information and it's not it's not necessarily displayed in the the friendliest

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,950
manner.

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,620
Anyway, if we read the description, it says this command creates an empty git repo, basically a dot

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,950
git directory with subdirectories for blah blah blah blah blah.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,970
So it creates a directory called dot git.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,720
Now if we know anything about hidden folders and hidden files, you'll know they all start with a dot

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,930
and there is a hidden folder that we're just not seeing in this directory where I can get init if i

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,330
type non case ls.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,230
I don't see anything but if I use the dash a flag that's one way of seeing all I think it's I don't

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,510
know if it's a for all that's what I tell myself.

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,060
All files hidden and non hidden.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,160
Now we see this folder.

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,440
Dot get.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,140
So if I wanted to, I could look at that.

29
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,670
We don't need to touch it or do anything in there, but this is what we just initialized.

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,510
So if I delete this, my git history is gone.

31
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,820
Now we can back it up and put it on GitHub and stuff like that once we get there.

32
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,810
But for now, just to prove this, I'm just going to back out of here.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,120
I Typekit status as we already have seen.

34
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,980
It tells me get stuff.

35
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,090
I'm in a repo.

36
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,760
If I back out one more level, just to be clear.

37
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,699
Now I'm I'm outside of this folder.

38
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,420
If I run git status, not a git repo.

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,900
Go back into my first novel, get status.

40
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,560
Okay.

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,810
So if I remove that folder rmd ref, you don't need to do this.

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,280
This is going to delete the entire get history for this project if I do that.

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,690
I typed get status.

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,930
I'm back to not being in a repository.

45
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,470
So that get folder is where all the get stuff occurs.

46
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,360
That's, that's what holds it all.

47
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,520
So I'm going to run get it again, which is it's okay here because we didn't have any history, but

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,520
we would have lost a whole bunch of stuff potentially if I did have history and I deleted that directory.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,870
So there's a reason it's hidden.

50
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,180
So you don't you don't screw with it.

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,860
So that's all I wanted to show you here.

52
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,090
That folder will be located in every git repository you initialize.

53
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,240
Here's this Yelp camp project where I have git.

54
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,890
This is an existing project.

55
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,820
If I do an LZ dash a there we are dot git.

56
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:16,140
And if I just take a look at that, there's a lot more stuff in this git folder than we had in our Git

57
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,730
folder because I've been using Git on this project here.

58
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,790
We just initialize this and we hadn't really done anything anyway.

59
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,130
In the next video, I'm going to talk about a common problem that people run into beginners with git

60
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,570
run into when they're starting out new repos and then we'll start learning the basics of adding and

61
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,170
committing.
