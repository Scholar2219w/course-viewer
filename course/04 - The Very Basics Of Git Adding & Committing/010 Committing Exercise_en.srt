1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,890
So it's time to get some practice with the concepts and commands I've covered in this section.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,030
So of course you don't have to do any of this, but I highly recommend you do, especially if you're

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,880
new to get and you haven't seen any of these commands before.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,310
This is an opportunity for you to get some practice.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,520
It's a simple exercise in terms of the content.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,910
The actual files we'll be working with are based around two shopping lists, so there is a link in the

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,440
resources for this video.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,210
I recommend you open it up.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,240
It contains a link to this exact page.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,890
It has the instructions I've typed up.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,350
So there are steps, a step by step set of instructions for what I'd like you to do, starting with

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,430
make a new folder called shopping, initialize a new git repo inside of it.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,790
Make sure you're not already in a git repo and then make a new file called yada txt then make a second

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:54,570
file groceries dot txt make a commit that includes both empty files, so a commit with both of those

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,050
files.

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,510
And then I tell you the exact message you should use.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,970
And if you deviate from that, it's not a big deal.

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:06,030
But anyway, I'm just putting it there if you want to follow that and then make some changes in the

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,340
yard txt file we actually add some content and then we add some content to the groceries and you can

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,790
just copy and paste from here and then make a second commit, including only the changes from the groceries

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,150
file and the message for the commit should say add ingredients for tomato soup, then make a second

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,960
commit, including only the changes from the yard file.

23
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,620
And that message should say add items needed for garden box.

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,820
And then next up, we're going to make some changes to both files.

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,880
We're going to add this line to the end of the yard file and then in the garden file, we're going to

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,020
change the quantity.

27
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,150
It did say two bags of potting soil.

28
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,920
We're going to update that to three.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,380
And then once both of those are done, we'll make a commit that includes both of those files.

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,360
And then you should use this message.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,600
And then the very last thing is to use some unnamed git commands that we've covered to display all of

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,450
those commits and we should see three commits.

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,180
So that's a set of instructions, hopefully straightforward, but don't feel bad if you don't remember

34
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,419
the exact commands, right?

35
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,820
You can always reference them.

36
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,530
It's more about making sure you have the conceptual flow down of how you make it commit.

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,130
Okay, so I highly recommend you try it and stop the video now because I'm going to just go through

38
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,440
the process myself if you want to watch.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,830
But again, I really strongly, strongly as I can through this pre-recorded video, I recommend that

40
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,790
you try this on your own and then if you get stuck, you can check out the solution.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,460
Okay, so step one create a new folder called shopping and init a repo inside of it.

42
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:48,180
So I have an empty folder called exercises and I'll make a shopping directory and CD into it.

43
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,790
Make sure it's not in a git repo.

44
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,050
I'm not so I'll run git init to make me that new repo.

45
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,740
Then it says make a new file called yada txt.

46
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,080
So I'll do that from the command line.

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,430
Although you don't have to.

48
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,090
But here we are.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:13,530
Touch yards txt and then make another new file called groceries oc touch groceries txt and then it says

50
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,520
make my first commit.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,650
That includes both empty files and then use this message and I'll just copy that message.

52
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,370
I guess.

53
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,460
So now if I run get status.

54
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,510
There are two files that I currently are not.

55
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,260
My repo is currently not tracking.

56
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,230
So before I can make a commit, I can't make a commit right now.

57
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,490
There's nothing to commit.

58
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:41,340
I need to stage those files so I'll do a get add groceries and yard.

59
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,680
I can do them separately or just in a single line.

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,480
Now I type get status.

61
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,400
Great.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,700
I'll do a git commit because that was the next instruction.

63
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,590
Using this message I copied create yard and groceries lists.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,710
All right, so now I have one commit down.

65
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,050
The next instruction says in the yard file.

66
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,140
Add these two lines, so I'll copy that and I need to open the yard file.

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,700
Technically, I could do this from the terminal, but I'm going to use I mean, you could just go to

68
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:19,050
your text editor and open the terminal or open the file, rather, or I can use the code shortcut if

69
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:24,840
I'm using vs code and you've configured that code and then I'll just do dot that will open the entire

70
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,420
directory for me in VS code and here it is.

71
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,590
I have my two files.

72
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:35,550
So in the yard file I'm going to paste this two bags of potting soil, one bag of worm castings, and

73
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,270
then in the groceries file I'm going to copy and paste this and save both of them.

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,490
And then it says Make a new commit, including only the changes from the groceries file.

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,920
And this is what the message should be.

76
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,060
So we made changes to two files, but we only want these changes in this first command.

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,540
So that's the groceries file.

78
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,310
If we do get status, we see both of them have been changed.

79
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm going to add I'll clear just to put this up top, get add groceries and that's all I'm going to

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,990
add.

81
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,350
So this will be included in the commit and I'll make that commit.

82
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:18,160
I'll use dash em and just do it from the command line and one go add ingredients for tomato soup.

83
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,220
And now we see that we still have those changes from yard that are not committed.

84
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,460
That's the next piece.

85
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,950
Make a second commit, including only the changes to the yard file and it should have this message.

86
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,740
Add items needed for garden box.

87
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,660
So we'll copy that.

88
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,320
Get add the yard file, get commit dash m.

89
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,730
There we go.

90
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:45,130
Add items needed for garden box and now we have no uncommitted changes.

91
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,770
And then the next step is to add the following line to the end of the groceries file.

92
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,660
So we need to buy a couple of seed potatoes, just potatoes that I'll buy from the grocery store.

93
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,580
So it goes in the groceries list.

94
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,280
Okay.

95
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:06,590
And then also I need to update the yard file so that it says three bags of potting soil instead of two.

96
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,330
So there we go.

97
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,930
And of course now if I type get status to files, both of them have been modified.

98
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,780
So now it says make a commit that includes both of those files.

99
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,200
So changes to both files with this message.

100
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,540
Add items needed to grow potatoes OC so I can do a get well.

101
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,010
I don't know why it did another status.

102
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:35,000
I just did that into a get add and then do both file names or it can do a get add dot to just add everything

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,300
which is these two files and then I'll do my get commit, dash em with that message.

104
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,390
And then the last piece, unfortunately I just realized there's a small typo here is to use an unspecified

105
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,750
command that we learned to display a list of all the commits.

106
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,090
This should actually say four because we've made four commits, the first empty one.

107
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,070
That's the one I forgot to count when I made this.

108
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,140
So let me update that very quickly.

109
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,780
That should say four instead of three.

110
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,160
Let's refresh.

111
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,690
And there we are.

112
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,770
You should see four.

113
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,990
Okay, so let's try this.

114
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,870
Let's go over here and the command is git log and I should now see four commits.

115
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,830
Here's the first one.

116
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,000
Create the empty lists.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,240
Here's where I added to the grocery list for tomato soup ingredients.

118
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,360
Here is what I added to the garden or the yard list.

119
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,730
And then here is where I added to both of them.

120
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,320
And that's the end of the exercise.

121
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,650
I hope that you're able to go through that and and not have to follow along with me step by step, although

122
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,970
there's no shame in that either.

123
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,270
You'll get more practice with this throughout the rest of the course.

124
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,070
This is really, really the bread and butter of git add, commit, add, commit.

125
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,640
We do it all day long or at least many times a day.

126
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,290
Okay.
