1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,690
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,480
So hopefully you now have get installed.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,410
We're now moving on to what is probably the most essential section in this course.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,290
We're talking about some of the core get commands.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,190
So there's going to be a lot in the critical column here.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,480
First, we're going to talk about this this concept of git repositories, repos for short, what are

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,870
they?

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,900
And then we'll learn a bunch of commands, get init.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,150
That's going to be critical and kit status.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,800
These are things you'll use non stop if you use git understanding the dot get folder I'll say is important

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,180
but not a critical thing.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,830
You could go your whole life as a get user without really understanding it and what's inside of it.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:44,130
The committing workflow, a very important concept, sort of an overview that we'll do and then we'll

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,260
dive into three more commands get, add, get commit and get log.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,350
None of them are terribly difficult or anything like that, but they are very, very important, essential

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,530
to working with Git and they'll come up throughout the rest of the course.

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,390
So take your time with this section.

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,620
Don't speed through it.

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,710
Remember how much is in the critical column because for future sections, that really won't be the case.

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,450
So let's go ahead and get started.

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,410
What really matters?

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,250
Pretty much everything.

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,270
Okay, here we go.
