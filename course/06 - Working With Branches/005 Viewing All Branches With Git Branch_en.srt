1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,860
Okey dokey.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,670
It's time to learn our first command.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,140
That has to do with branching.

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,190
And it's pretty simple.

5
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,260
One, it is get branch, get space branch, nothing else.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:17,280
This will just give us a list of our current existing branches in a repo so it doesn't make a new branch,

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,520
it doesn't switch branches, it just shows you the current branches.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,760
In our case, we haven't made new branches, so we won't see anything except Master.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,100
So I'm on my first novel for now.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,020
I'm going to make a new repository in a moment.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,920
If I type git branch, I see one branch master and to get out of here, just like with git log I type

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,520
q.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,290
Now I'll show you a different project.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,780
This repository has a couple more branches.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,570
If I type git branch, you can see them all here.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,260
Birds.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:47,980
Birds of prey.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,060
California mammals.

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,510
Hawks.

20
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,960
Mammals.

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,190
Master no animals.

22
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:51,850
Owls.

23
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,050
Stash test.

24
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,570
I was testing something out there.

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,320
You can see though, there's a bunch of branches, but the one that is active has a little asterisk

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,130
next to it.

27
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,530
That's the branch we're currently on.

28
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,880
So we see I'm on owls and again I can type Q to get out of here.

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,440
So here on my first novel project, we only have Master.

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,550
I never made that branch and it's the only branch we have, so we're on it.

31
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,050
We don't really have a choice right now.

32
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,540
But next up, we're going to learn how to make a new branch.
