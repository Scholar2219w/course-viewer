1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,620
So it's time for an exercise to get some practice with get branches.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,380
So this is going to be a simple exercise in terms of the files we're working with, kind of silly.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,150
It's Harry Potter themed, but it doesn't matter if you know Harry Potter or don't if you just follow

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,770
the instructions and make the branches.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,030
When you're prompted to make branches and switch branches, when you're prompted to switch, you should

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,890
be good to go.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,620
Now, the theme of this, aside from Harry Potter, is of Harry Potter Patronages, which are like,

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,230
I guess a Harry Potter version of a spirit animal.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,790
If you've seen the movie or read the books, the spell expected petroleum, I don't even know why I'm

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,300
going into it.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,440
It doesn't matter anyway.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,810
Wizards have their own patronus different animals.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:46,350
So you will be putting some animals in files on different branches for different characters.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,830
So again, I strongly recommend you do this on your own.

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,800
Follow the instructions you can find this file link to in the resources for this video.

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,000
You're going to make a new directory, make a new git repo inside of it, make sure you're not already

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,730
in one, then you'll create a new file called Petronas txt and you'll leave it empty for now.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,770
So this will be on your default branch, the master branch or if you've changed the default name, whatever

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,610
it is main.

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,400
But for now the default is just master.

22
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,280
Then we'll make our first commit with this message.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,900
Add empty patronus file.

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,010
Then we'll make a new branch called Hairy and at the same time, or in the next line, a second new

25
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,330
branch called Snape.

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,730
Both of them should be based on the master branch.

27
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,890
They should contain this empty patronus file.

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,670
Then you will move to the hairy branch that you just made.

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,950
And there are two different ways we've talked about for moving to new branches or moving between branches.

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,040
So I would like you to use the new command.

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,520
If you don't remember which one is new and old, it's not a big deal.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,710
Just use one of the commands that we talked about and then later on use the other command that you didn't

33
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,310
use.

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,550
So on the hairy branch, we are going to put this inside of the Patronus file.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,400
Harry Potter's Patronus is a stag, so copy all of this and put it in that file, save it, add and

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,039
commit the changes and then use this message.

37
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,180
Add Harry Stag Patronus and again this is on the Harry branch.

38
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,740
Then you will move over to the other branch you already made called Snape.

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,230
So this branch again should be based off of master when you made it early on, at the same time as the

40
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,080
Harry branch, when you move over to that branch, use the other command, the older command, to switch

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,580
or to change branches and then open up the Patronus file again.

42
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,530
And this time put this in there.

43
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,010
Snape's Patronus is a doe, so this is what you'll put in there, save it, add in commits and then

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,930
use this message if you'd like.

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,390
Then something different.

46
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,060
We will make a new branch based upon the Snape branch and we're going to call it Lily.

47
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,630
If you don't know any of these characters, it really doesn't matter.

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,570
All you need to know is that Snape and Lily have the same patronus.

49
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,330
So we are branching off of Snape to a new branch called Lily, and then we will move to that branch,

50
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,670
to the Lily branch, and we'll edit this file and we're going to keep the DOE in there because they

51
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,690
have the same patronus.

52
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,480
But we will edit this little header so that it says Lily's patronus instead of Snape's.

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,830
You can leave the DOE alone.

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,460
That's the point.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,770
They share the same patronus the same form.

56
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,150
Then you'll add and commit.

57
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,010
You can use this message if you want.

58
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,660
So this is on the lily branch.

59
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,480
Then run a command to list all the branches.

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,470
You should see four.

61
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,630
So just making sure you remember that command.

62
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,660
And then as a bonus, delete the Snape branch.

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,500
Poor Snape.

64
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,760
Okay.

65
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,600
So if you're still here, I really recommend.

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,880
I insist that you try it on your own.

67
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,840
But if you want to, just watch me do it.

68
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,580
Here we go.

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,130
So I'm going to make a new folder called Petronas.

70
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
Let's just do that here.

71
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,240
Petronas.

72
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,620
I'll seed into it.

73
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,860
I'm going to initialize a repo, but first make sure I'm not in one.

74
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:56,850
Okay.

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,810
So now I have this folder and a new repo in it and I'm going to create a file called Petronas txt,

76
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:14,010
Petronas Dot txt and then I'm going to add and commit with this message add empty Petronas file.

77
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:20,220
So get add that file, get commit m there's my message and there we go.

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,269
That's the first bit.

79
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,910
Now immediately make a new branch called Hairy and another new branch called snip, both based on the

80
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,190
master branch I'm currently on master, so that works to our advantage.

81
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,410
I'm going to make a new branch called Hairy and another one called Snake OC.

82
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,970
Next step move to the hairy branch using the new way of doing it.

83
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:49,500
The new command is get switch so we'll move over using git switch to the hairy branch and now we see

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,490
that we're on hairy.

85
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,090
Then in the Petronas file add the following.

86
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,510
So I need to open up that file so I'll do a copied all of that first of all, but then I'll use my code

87
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,050
shortcut code.

88
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,600
Just do the whole folder.

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,220
Here's that Petronas File.

90
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,020
I will paste that in there.

91
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,670
Let me zoom out a bit.

92
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,190
Okay.

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,300
So I'll save that and then it wants me to add and commit the changes with this commit message.

94
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,590
All right.

95
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:24,360
So we'll do a git, add Petronas, get commit m and paste in that message.

96
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,720
Okay.

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,330
So we should now have two commits on this branch.

98
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,890
Next, we are going to move over to the snake branch using the other the older command, which is git

99
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,700
checkout.

100
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,410
So we'll do that.

101
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,360
Get checkout snip.

102
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,940
You could use switch that right there.

103
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,020
Both going to work.

104
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,530
But I just want you to get practice with both.

105
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:53,130
So I'm now on the snake branch as my terminal tells me and I'm going to put this in the Patronus file.

106
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,460
Now, if I take a look, the Patronus file is empty, right?

107
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,510
Because I branched off of Master before anything was in here.

108
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,640
I didn't branch from the Harry Potter or the Harry Branch.

109
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,440
I'll save that.

110
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,870
And then I'm going to make a new commit.

111
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,780
With that change and this message.

112
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:21,530
So get add Petronas get commit dash em on the snake branch, add Snape's Doe, Petronas and then I need

113
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,690
to make a new branch based on the snake branch called Lili and then move to it.

114
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,620
So I could just do git branch.

115
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,180
Lily I'm on snake and that's where I should be.

116
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,210
If I want to branch based on Snape, I want this history.

117
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:43,070
Just to remind you, if I do a get log to commits, add empty file, add snape's doe patronus.

118
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:49,490
So if I do a git branch lily that will work or I can make the branch and switch to it in one go like

119
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:55,190
this get switched dash see lily and that made it and it switched me over.

120
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,520
I still see add snape's doe patronus.

121
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,740
Right.

122
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,740
The file contains the doe.

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,750
Now I'm going to edit it so that it says Lily's Patronus instead of snape's.

124
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,930
So I'll put that up top and then I will add and commit.

125
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,770
So just copy this message.

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,730
Get status.

127
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,580
We modified Petronas so we add, we commit and we'll give it that message.

128
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,390
OC Next and almost at the end run a get command to list all branches we should see four.

129
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,060
So what does that command?

130
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,260
It's just get branch and nothing else.

131
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,460
Just get branch.

132
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:39,240
We see four I'm currently on Lily and then bonus delete the Snape branch.

133
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,680
Oh poor Snape.

134
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:49,380
Well to delete a branch we saw that we use the exact same command get branch and then a branch name

135
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,770
but we pass in this dash dx, get branch dash dx and then Snape, that's the name of the branch.

136
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,210
Make sure I'm not on that branch.

137
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,440
I'm currently not.

138
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,940
And there we go.

139
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,990
It was deleted.

140
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,270
So now if I do just regular get branch only three branches and that's it.

141
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,280
That's the end of the branching exercise OC.
