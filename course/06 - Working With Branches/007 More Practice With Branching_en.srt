1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,990
In this video.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,910
We'll continue to make some more branches.

3
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,590
And I'm also going to show you another way, another command we can use to make and switch to a branch.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,510
But first, I want to pay special attention to this part of the the first paragraph here.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,520
You get branch with a branch name to make a new branch based upon the current head.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,440
That part is super important.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,520
It tells us that where we are, what head is, when we create a branch, impacts the branch that we

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,240
create.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,540
So the location, the current branch we're on when we branch is very, very important and makes a huge

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,350
difference.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,830
So for example, here I've got my road trip playlist.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,960
I don't want to call it an app, but our repo, just from the previous video and I'm currently on the

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,240
oldest branch I Typekit log.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,360
I have the commits from master these two and then I have the new commit I added on the oldest branch.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,510
So I'm going to add, how about two more songs?

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,370
George Harrison Songs, My Sweet Lord, and what is Life by George Harrison?

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,850
And I'm going to add and commit those and I'm actually going to do it in a different way.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,620
I haven't showed you a dash cam is basically a one line way of adding all on stage changes.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,190
So get commit dash a instead of add and then commit.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,050
And then I'll provide my message.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,500
Just add to George Harrison's songs.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,910
All right.

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,780
So now I have another commit that I've added to the oldest branch.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,620
So if I branch right now and make a new branch, let's say I make a George's branch I want to make yeah,

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,250
I guess a playlist that only includes songs by George's.

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,360
I can do that.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,150
I'll branch from the oldest branch.

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,590
That's where I am right now.

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,190
So I can do git branch George's.

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,820
So I made that branch.

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,510
Of course I'm still on oldies I haven't switched over, but if we look at git log we see that both oldies

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,580
and my new branch George's.

33
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,010
They are both referring to the same commit.

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,900
They're at the same spot.

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,110
The same page has been bookmarked with two different bookmarks.

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,720
Head is currently pointing to oldies, but if I want to switch to George's and make a commit on George's,

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,250
of course they will diverge.

38
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,120
So if I switch over, get switch to George's.

39
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,510
We go get log.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,500
Only thing that has changed here is that head now points to George's and I have all those commits from

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,240
the earlier oldest branch on Georges, so now I can do a bit more work.

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,840
I'll add what's another add to George Michael songs.

43
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,490
Okay, so there we go.

44
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,310
Careless Whisper and Faith by George Michael.

45
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:45,650
I'll just add and commit them to the same thing a m Add to George Michael songs.

46
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,980
And this of course only goes on the George's branch.

47
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,450
That's the branch I'm currently on.

48
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,350
So now if I type git log, what do we expect to see?

49
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:01,820
Head refers to George's because I'm on the George's branch and I have this one commit that only exists

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,170
on the George's branch and the oldest branch was left in the dust back here.

51
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:14,390
Right, so I could switch back to oldies get switch all these and we see we lose those two songs also.

52
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,670
You know, I actually left in those ABBA songs, so I should switch back to George's.

53
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,330
And I want to delete those ABBA songs because they're not created by George's, and unfortunately we're

54
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,770
only allowing George's here.

55
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,100
So now I'll do another get ad and get comments or just the short version.

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm on the George's branch.

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,860
So don't forget that.

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,480
Remove to ABBA songs.

59
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,100
All right, so now get log.

60
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:48,620
I have these two new commits on the George's branch that I'm currently on, plus all the other commits

61
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,250
from the oldest branch at that moment in time when I split.

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,710
So just at that moment in time, if I do more work on oldies, it does not impact George's OC.

63
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,620
So now I go back to oldies, get switch oldies, and we see ABBA is back and we don't have George Michael.

64
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,110
If I go back to Master, almost everything's gone.

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
We just have ABBA.

66
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:18,649
So if I make one more branch from here, just as a quick demo, it's going to be based upon master that

67
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,690
I currently am.

68
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,620
So I know I'm beating this dead horse a lot, but it's really important where you branch from matters.

69
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,340
And if I make a new branch get branch, what should this one be?

70
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,470
How about just an empty playlist?

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,450
Get branch.

72
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,020
Empty playlist.

73
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,010
I now have this branch referring to the same spot as master.

74
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,550
And now I'll switch over, get switch empty playlist.

75
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,050
And here we are.

76
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
So now I can delete everything if I wanted to.

77
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,880
Get commit a m.

78
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,620
Empty Out playlist.

79
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,690
And there we go.

80
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,900
If I look at the log, I only have three commits, the two from master and then the one new one.

81
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,780
Anyway, this has been a long demonstration, but I just wanted to show it does matter where you branch

82
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,410
from.

83
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,360
So we go back to master.

84
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,000
If I whoops I get switch master.

85
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,510
We have ABA.

86
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,100
If I go back to George's get switch George's.

87
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,620
There we are.

88
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,490
And if I get switch back to empty playlist, that's all we've got.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,770
OC.
