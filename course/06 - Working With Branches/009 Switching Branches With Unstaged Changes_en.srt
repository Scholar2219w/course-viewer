1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,100
This is going to be a very quick video.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,210
I just need to explain one thing that we haven't run into yet.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,340
If I'm on a branch and I have some work that is not currently committed, so let's go to the oldest

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,270
branch, get switch oldies and I'll do some work here.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,690
Like I'll add two Van Morrison songs, great songs, and it's done Me and Caravan, so I'll save those

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,200
too.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,420
But I'm not going to add in commits.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,580
So over here I see get status.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,490
I modified that I have changes that are not staged.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,460
There's work on this branch that has not been committed.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,360
If I try and switch branches right now, let's see what happens.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,480
Let's go back to the how about our empty playlist, get switch empty playlist and what does it say?

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,860
I get an error.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,480
Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout playlist.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,060
TXT It's telling me that the work I have done right now that I have not yet committed, which is right

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,540
here.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,430
If I try and switch to a different branch, it's going to be lost because it's not committed.

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,200
This branch doesn't know about it.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,570
There's not going to be a bookmark for it in the really large book before we change pages.

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,470
So it says Please commit your changes or stash them.

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,490
We will learn more about stashing in just a couple of sections from now.

22
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,050
So for now, that's not an option.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,480
For now, our only option is to commit our work or just delete it, I guess, and not make those changes.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:33,570
So I am going to commit that get add playlist, get commit Dash Am, add two Van Morrison songs.

25
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,450
Just like that.

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,210
And now I can switch so I can do the same command to switch to empty playlists.

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,310
No complaints.

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,440
So if you run into an issue like this, hopefully you understand why.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,500
Now get is warning you you're going to lose those changes.

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,770
You either need to stash them, which we haven't learned or commit them.

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,060
Now, the last example I showed you, we had changes that were in conflict, right?

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,080
When I tried to switch branches, we were working on the same file, this playlist file, and they were

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,770
in conflict.

34
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,980
And so get yelled at me and said, Hey, I don't know what to do.

35
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,110
We'll learn more about conflicts when we get to merging, but sometimes that's not an issue at all.

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,250
So if I make a new file, for example, I'm on the oldest branch.

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,700
Let me make a new branch here, get switch C and this branch will be.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,690
I don't know.

39
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,690
How about chicken?

40
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,310
I'm going to delete it.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,420
A chicken branch.

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,140
And on this chicken branch, I'm going to make a new file entirely called chickens txt and I'll put

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,900
some of my chickens in here like Stevie Chicks.

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,350
So I have this new file no other branch has, but I haven't added or committed that file.

45
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,090
And so now if I switch again, let's go back to oldest get switch oldies.

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,720
Previously at the beginning of this video we saw that get yelled at me when I tried to switch and it

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,740
says You can't switch.

48
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,980
You have changes that are going to be overridden that you're in conflict.

49
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,030
We don't know what to do.

50
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,590
Please stash or commit them.

51
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,460
But this is going to be different because no other branch has this file.

52
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,430
There's no way that it's in conflict with anything.

53
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,450
So what actually will happen is this this file is going to come with me.

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,700
I'm now on the oldest branch.

55
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,950
And I still have chickens.

56
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,520
You see that?

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,720
The file is still there.

58
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,590
And it came with me and it still says, Hey, there's this untracked file.

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,270
You haven't made it commit with it anywhere.

60
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,910
It's just going to follow you to every branch you go to.

61
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,630
So for now, I'm just going to recommend we always add and commit changes before we switch branches

62
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,920
so that we can avoid this.

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,850
But of course, like I said, we're going to learn how to stash changes very soon.

64
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,750
First, we're going to learn about merging, but I just want to call your attention to this behavior.

65
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,120
When you switch branches, sometimes, if you have unstaged changes, they will come with you.

66
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,650
Other times, if they're in conflict, get will yell at you.

67
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,860
So just know that.
