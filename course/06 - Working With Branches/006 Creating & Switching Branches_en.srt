1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,630
So next up, we're going to learn how to make our first branch.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:10,770
And we actually use the same command that we just saw get branch, except now we add on a branch name.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,860
So get branch with a branch name, we'll create a branch with that name versus Git branch without anything

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,280
else.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,590
Just lists the current branches.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,130
So get branch branch name and your branch name.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
We'll talk a little bit more about later, but it shouldn't include spaces.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,200
Let's just start with that.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,230
And generally you want it to make sense and be informative, but you don't need to write a whole sentence

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,610
to explain what the branch is.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,940
Also, this simply makes a branch for us.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,580
It does not switch to the branch.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,830
So I'm on my master branch here.

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,230
As you can see, head points at master.

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,810
I have two commits on the master branch when I run this command to get branch bug fix.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,660
That makes me a new branch called Bug Fix.

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,810
It's based off of the head where I currently was, so it points to the same exact spot.

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,800
But I have a new branch.

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,640
I have not switched to it.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,380
I'm still on, master.

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,390
So I'll demonstrate this to you.

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,520
Let's make a new branch.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,450
But first, I'm actually going to work on a separate project, a separate repo.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
Instead of working on the novel.

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,260
We were writing The Great Gatsby.

27
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,940
I'm going to make a new repo.

28
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,690
I'm in a folder.

29
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,890
I'm just calling it branching and I'm going to make a directory.

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,170
I'm going to make a road trip playlist folder.

31
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,990
So often when I'm teaching this stuff, I'm torn if I should do something.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,700
Very easy to follow along with.

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,320
Something simple to understand.

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,740
Or if I should do something realistic, I'm going to try and do both.

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,910
But I'm going to start with the super simple, easy to understand project.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,190
So it's not really a project.

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,060
We're going on a road trip and I want a playlist of songs and I'm going to use Git for whatever reason

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,630
to track those songs and I'll make some different branches.

39
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,180
So I'm going to start by making my repository.

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,250
So I'm in a folder, road trip playlist.

41
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,990
I'm going to run, get it.

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,640
So I have an empty repo.

43
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,650
I know that I wasn't in a git repo, but I should have checked to see with git status.

44
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,880
But I know that I wasn't.

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,030
And then I'm going to go ahead and make a file.

46
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm going to call it playlist.

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,460
Dot txt and I'll open this up in my editor.

48
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,410
So here it is.

49
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,960
I'm just going to start by adding a very simple heading like song artist.

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,710
So it's just the header heading for the playlist.

51
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,940
All right, I'm going to add that file, get add playlist, get commit.

52
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm on the master branch, of course, just by default.

53
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,640
Add playlist header.

54
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,980
All right, we type get log.

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,920
We see head is pointing to the master branch.

56
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,230
Now I'm going to add two songs just to add songs to start that I happen to like.

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,750
There they are songs.

58
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,940
Great song, one of us also great song.

59
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,710
I'm going to add those.

60
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,590
I just want to have one or two commits on my master branch.

61
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:05,850
So I'm going to do git add playlist, get commit, add to Abi's songs.

62
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,540
All righty.

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,880
So I'm on the master branch, right?

64
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,350
Head points to master.

65
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,490
We have two commits.

66
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,680
Now let's make a new branch.

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,830
For whatever reason I decide I want to make a different playlist based on this one that only contains

68
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,640
oldies.

69
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,460
So maybe I'm not sure what I want on my main playlist, so I'm going to try a couple of options, and

70
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,510
that's exactly what I'm going to do, is make some different branches and I'm going to make a branch

71
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,910
called oldies, and it's just going to include songs that are they're not technically what the radio

72
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:42,480
would classify as oldies, but let's just say anything from before, like 2000, which I recognize for

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,590
most people is not oldies.

74
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,910
So to make a branch, get branch and then a branch name.

75
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,590
So let's make that oldest branch get branch, I'll make this full screen.

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,010
And then actually before I do that, let's just do Git Branch.

77
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,240
We're on master.

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,080
It's the only branch now if I do get branch oldies.

79
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,870
And hit enter.

80
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,380
Hmm.

81
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,600
It doesn't seem like anything happened.

82
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,130
I'm still on, Master.

83
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,590
If I type get status, I'm still on master.

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,680
No surprise there.

85
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,390
It doesn't switch us over.

86
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,399
But if I type get branch, we do see we have a new branch oldies.

87
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,959
We're just not on it.

88
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,420
Head is still pointing to master.

89
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,770
You can see that again type get log head is pointing to master.

90
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,470
But now we have this new reference oldies.

91
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,110
It's at the same commit right to branch references pointing to the same thing.

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,630
We just happen to be on master.

93
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,750
So we're at this stage two branches.

94
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,070
They're both referring to the same point, the same commit and we're on master.

95
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,870
So to switch branches, there's a command that we can use called get switch.

96
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,750
So this is actually a newer command in Git.

97
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,720
I'll do a separate video on the older command.

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,930
We used something called Git Checkout to do the same thing.

99
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,160
We'll talk about that.

100
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,310
It's still used in other contexts, but get switch was introduced to switch between branches, so get

101
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,810
switch and then a branch name.

102
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:14,670
So in our example here, if I do get switch bug fix head is now pointing to that bug fix branch.

103
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,280
It was on master, now it's on bug fix.

104
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,090
So in our case we have this oldest branch, we are not on it.

105
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,870
We see that we're on master type get status, we're on master.

106
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,630
But if I do get switch oldies and I do need to spell it correctly so if I reference something that doesn't

107
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,360
exist, it tells me there's no branch with that name.

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,120
But if I do get switch oldies.

109
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,480
Hey switch to branch oldies.

110
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,210
My terminal shows oldies over here.

111
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:50,730
If I type get status on branch oldies and if I type git log you can now see head is pointing to oldies.

112
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,490
Still the same commit though I haven't done any new work.

113
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,530
However, if I do some new work and make a new commit here, this is the oldies playlist.

114
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,960
So what should we add?

115
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,590
Let's add to good great George Jones songs.

116
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,760
He stopped loving her today.

117
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,570
Great song.

118
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,230
Great song.

119
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:15,300
So I'm going to save and I'm going to commit now when I commit here, remember, I'm on the Old East

120
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:26,430
Branch, so get add playlist, get commit, add to George Jones songs just like that.

121
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,370
And we just made our first commit on a new branch.

122
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,900
We're on the oldest branch and if I type get log, we're going to see something we haven't yet seen.

123
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,420
We see head referring to oldies.

124
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,010
That's what we expect to see.

125
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,330
It's our most recent commit.

126
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,330
That's where oldest is because we're on the oldest branch.

127
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,410
But we see Master now has been left behind on this previous commit.

128
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,250
Master is still remember this idea of a bookmark in the book.

129
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,140
It's still bookmarking this commit.

130
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,730
This is master, this is oldies and we happen to be on the oldest branch.

131
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,000
But I can switch as we've seen with git switch.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,770
So if I switch right now this is what we have on our oldest branch.

133
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,800
If I switch over, get switch to master.

134
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,160
Take a look.

135
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,730
Now we have just two lines, just two songs, rather.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We don't have the George Jones stuff that we did.

137
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,700
If I type, get log on the master branch.

138
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:28,030
We only have these two commits, add the playlist header, add two ABBA songs, but when I switch back,

139
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,220
get switch to oldies.

140
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:37,300
We now have our two George Jones songs in addition and I type get log, we have that extra commit.

141
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,360
So that was just our first example of making a branch and switching.

142
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,200
We will get more practice in the next video, but just to remind you, get branch on its own, we'll

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,260
list branches, get branch with a branch name, makes a branch and then to switch to a branch we use

144
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,870
git switch followed by the branch name.
