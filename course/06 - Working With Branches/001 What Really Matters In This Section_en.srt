00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,470
In this section we cover one of the most useful features in git branching.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,680
So everything in this section has to do with branching.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,590
And branching is really one of the last topics I would say that you have to master and have to be comfortable

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,260
with in order to use git day to day.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,900
There are plenty of other topics we cover in this course, but those may not come up as frequently.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,030
Branching will come up on a daily basis, just like committing if you work with Git daily at least.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,110
So we start by covering branching at a conceptual level.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,020
What is it?

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,310
What are the benefits?

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,410
Why would you use it?

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,610
And that is going to be critical.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,440
I've marked it in yellow, not because it's hard, but it does take up a little bit more time than learning

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,430
a single command.

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,750
But I really recommend you don't skip through the videos before the commands.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,170
Everyone likes to just get to the the midi stuff, show me the commands.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,530
But with branching it really helps to understand with diagrams.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,820
Plus I introduced a couple of concepts, including something called Get Head.

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,370
You've probably seen that term so far on your terminal.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,550
That's also going to be critical understanding what head is and the fact that it points to something

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,240
called a branch reference and a branch reference points to a commit.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,490
All this stuff we cover in these two videos, other crucial things understanding the git branch command,

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,580
the get switch command, the git checkout command.

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,700
Then I'll say that deleting and renaming branches is important, but not as important as this other

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,390
stuff.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,150
Head in reps behind the scenes.

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm going to say it's nice to have this is just an explanation of or it's proof of how some of these

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,630
concepts work.

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,780
I actually show you in the git directory, so it's nice to have it'll make you a more, I guess, well-rounded

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,740
or informed ticket developer, but you don't need to know it in order to use Git.

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,430
And then we spend a little bit of time, not a whole lot talking about branch naming and the issue that

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,240
came up in late 2020 or early 2021 around renaming the default branch from master to main.

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,330
So that will make more sense once we talk about branches.

33
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,100
But I'm going to say it's important, but it's not critical to understand in order to use Git.
