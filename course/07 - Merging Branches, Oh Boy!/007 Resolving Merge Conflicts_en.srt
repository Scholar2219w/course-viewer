1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,030
So in this video, I'm going to demonstrate generating a merge conflict and then resolving it.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,930
And I'm going to keep working with our simple repository.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,390
Currently it has two branches, Master and ABA, but I'm actually going to delete the ABA branch because

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,860
I merged in those changes and let's say I'm done with it, so I'm going to delete it.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,600
There's a couple of ways of doing it.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,680
I've actually already shown this, but basically get Branch Dash DX and then a branch name and you want

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,420
to make sure you're not on that branch.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,110
So if I want to delete this ABA branch, I'm not on it.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,280
So get branch, I'll do a full screen dash dx aba and it's gone.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,750
So I had all of the changes merged into Master, so it doesn't warn me.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,360
When I first introduced how to delete a branch, it did warn us because we hadn't learned how to merge

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,700
changes in, but now everything is merged in.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,370
I don't need to force this delete with a capital DX.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,640
Okay, so now we have just the master branch.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,210
All right, so now what I'm going to do to demonstrate merge conflicts is I'm going to make two branches

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,140
and I'll do it quickly.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,290
I'll probably fast forward through a lot of it, one for our friend Bjorn and another for our friend.

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,970
I don't know Serena.

20
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,770
And they're going to each have their own branch where they can make their own playlist for the road

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,440
trip, and they're definitely not going to agree.

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,640
So they'll make their own playlist on their own branch, and then I'll merge them together when we're

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,930
ready for our road trip.

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,830
So I'll start by making Serena's branch, so I'll do it in one go get switched dash, see Serena.

25
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:44,310
And then I'll also go back to master, get switch master and then I'll make the other branch get switched.

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,650
Dash See for Bjorn.

27
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,150
All right, so now we have two branches.

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,170
Well, we have three, but we have two that we just made Serena and Bjorn, and they're all referring

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
to the same spot that master currently is.

30
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,700
So now we're going to switch over.

31
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,870
Let's we're on Bjorn.

32
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,820
So let's just work on Bjorn's branch.

33
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,759
Bjorn really does not like Abba that much, but he likes Dancing Queen, so he's going to keep Dancing

34
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,360
Queen.

35
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,220
Then we're going to add some music in that Bjorn does.

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,700
Like Bjorn likes a band called King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard.

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,590
So he adds that in.

38
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,930
We'll make it commit for him or he makes a commit.

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,880
I'll just do it here.

40
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,490
Stage all changes and I'm just going to do King Gizzard Lizard Wizard Song.

41
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,230
All right.

42
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,210
So we're on The Bjorn.

43
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,280
Branch, and he adds One more song.

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,080
What should he do here?

45
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,400
He likes The Strokes, so he adds both or two songs in By The Strokes OC.

46
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,980
He stages them, he commits Add to Strokes songs.

47
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:56,790
Then simultaneously, Serena is working on her branch and she likes Abba quite a bit.

48
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,910
She even goes as far as to add another Abba song in, she adds.

49
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,670
What is it?

50
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,570
Gimme, gimme, I think by Abba.

51
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,600
So she makes that commit.

52
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,840
Stages her change.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,720
Add one ABBA song.

54
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,090
Okay.

55
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,570
And she does one more change.

56
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,530
What else does she like?

57
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,870
She likes Dolly Parton.

58
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,970
So she adds, Here you come again.

59
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,230
So she adds that change.

60
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,050
She stages it.

61
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,220
She commits add one Dolly Parton song.

62
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,890
Okay.

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,720
So now when we take a look, if we ignore everything that we did earlier, we just look from here and

64
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,530
above, we can see that we have two branches we're ignoring master.

65
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,450
We have Serena and we have Bjorn.

66
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:50,200
And Serena has two commits that don't exist on Bjorn, and Bjorn has two commits that don't exist on

67
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,920
Serena.

68
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,970
But unlike the previous merge we did where we were merging this ABBA branch with the master branch,

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,590
there were no conflicts there.

70
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:06,250
Here, there are definitely conflicts because we're editing the same file and some of the same lines.

71
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:12,160
So when I switch right, I'll switch one more time from Serena now to Bjorn.

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,850
We can see there's a lot of changes going on in there.

73
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,620
So when I try and merge the two, we're going to run into an issue.

74
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,720
So now I have to decide where I want to do the merging.

75
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,250
Do I want them to still have separate branches and just continue to have separate branches?

76
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,020
If so, maybe I'll make a third branch.

77
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,370
I'll call that one.

78
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,420
What should it be?

79
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,260
Get switched c combination or just combo?

80
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,390
And I'm branching from Bjorn.

81
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,470
That's where I am now.

82
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:48,640
So it will include all the stuff from Bjorn and then I can merge in the changes from Serena OC.

83
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,900
So now I have this new combo branch, it's at the same spot as Bjorn.

84
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,520
They're referencing the same commit.

85
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,910
Now I'm going to merge in Serena, so here we are.

86
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:05,200
I'm on combo which contains the same stuff as the Bjorn branch I'm going to do get merge so Rina and

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,610
here we go it tries to auto merge nope conflict merge conflict in songs text automatic merge failed

88
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,130
fix conflicts and then commit the result.

89
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,960
So we go to our editor.

90
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,460
I'm using vs code.

91
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,100
You can see it does some nice highlighting for me and we have those markers I mentioned so you can see

92
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,510
head right here from that line down to here those equal sign.

93
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,300
This is what we had on the branch originally.

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,840
In our case it was the combo branch so we can see it.

95
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,750
It's Bjorn's changes and then here this is the change or the changes we had coming in from the Serena

96
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,350
branch.

97
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,980
And I have to decide, do I want just Serena stuff?

98
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,300
Do I want Jess Bjorn's?

99
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,920
No, I want both.

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,330
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete these markers.

101
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,530
We get rid of those.

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,260
So all of that.

103
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,040
And then I'm going to keep, you know, where they have overlap.

104
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,810
For example, Dancing Queen is on both of them.

105
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,930
I don't want Dancing Queen twice, so I'm going to do that.

106
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,060
And otherwise I think everything is unique.

107
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,890
The point is, it's up to me.

108
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,860
It's totally up to me what I want to keep and don't keep.

109
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,960
And in this case, I mean, if we're doing a playlist to friends, I guess it's fair, it's equitable

110
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,920
to allow them both just take both of their songs and combine them.

111
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,000
But if I wanted to, I could say, You know what, I only like Serena songs.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,220
I'm getting rid of you, Bjorn.

113
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,230
And I could do that.

114
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,560
I could just get rid of that and say, This is what we're going with, but I'm not going to I'm going

115
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,790
to keep both of their songs in there and I just remove the duplicate which was Dancing Queen.

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,590
So now I save.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,720
So go back to this guide here.

118
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,760
First step, open the files.

119
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,380
Second, edit the files.

120
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,600
Third, remove the conflict markers.

121
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,380
We did that.

122
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,710
Fourth, add changes and make a commit.

123
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,650
So whoops, I need to go back to my terminal.

124
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:01,390
We type get status and it tells us we're on this branch combo on merged paths and it tells us this songs

125
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,610
that text file has been modified so now we just add the changes.

126
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:07,940
Okay.

127
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,400
And then we commit, get, commit and we can just do something like resolve conflicts or.

128
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,540
It's up to you really.

129
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,330
But I'll just do resolve conflicts to keep it short and simple.

130
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,520
And that's what this commit is.

131
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,970
This commit is us merging and resolving those conflicts.

132
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,190
So now let's head over to our little visualization here.

133
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,000
It looks exactly the same as what we had earlier.

134
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,600
It's the same process, right?

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,760
We merged this branch, Serena, into combo and we have this new merge commit.

136
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,480
The difference is that we had to do some work to make that commit.

137
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,180
We didn't just approve a commit message like we did a couple of videos ago.

138
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,160
Instead, we actually had to dig into a file and make some changes.

139
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,770
We had to look at those markers that get adds for us, these things, and figure out what we wanted

140
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,820
to keep from the two branches and then make changes save and then add and commit.

141
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,050
But now that conflict has been resolved and we're on our new branch combo, which includes the commits

142
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,720
that it had earlier from Bjorn and the new commits from Serena and the conflicts there that we manually

143
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,440
resolved.
