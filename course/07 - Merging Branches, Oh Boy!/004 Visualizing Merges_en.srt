00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,450
In this video I want to use get crackin as a way to visualize our branches and specifically to visualize

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,950
the merging process.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,910
So I have get cracking open with this playlist repository.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,460
We just merged our two branches.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,680
We merged oldest into master.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,760
Unfortunately, I've been trying desperately to zoom this in.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,260
This is as far as it lets me go.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,600
For whatever reason, I hope that you can see this.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,780
Otherwise I'll try and make it a bit larger in post-production, although it might be blurry anyway.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,550
I have my road trip playlist repository open and if you need to know if you don't remember how to open

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,100
that, just go to view all repositories or you can actually click right there to open a repository and

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,740
then navigate to the right folder and open it.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,170
So here it is and I can see each branch reference over here on the left side now.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,050
Master and oldies are currently referring to the exact same commits because that's where they are.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,190
They are in sync with one another right now, but I'm going to change that.

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm actually going to add some more work to the oldest branch and then merge it back into master eventually.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,750
But for now I'm going to go to the oldest branch, so let's switch over, get switch oldies and then

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,060
I'm just going to add another song or two here.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,620
So I added two songs by Wings Band on the Run and Live and Let Die.

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,270
Let's add both of those.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,570
Get commit dash a dash m add to Wings songs.

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,830
So we added that to oldies, right?

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,760
Master no longer is up to date or in sync with oldies.

24
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,490
Oldies now has a commit that master does not.

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,940
Obviously if I switch to master, we see that go away.

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,010
So now if we go back to get crackin, we can see here's master.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,900
The last commit master has is this one add to Van Morrison songs oldies is now one commit ahead and

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,540
it has Add to Wings songs.

29
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,060
So I can do one more example.

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,860
Let's just add two more songs.

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,530
How about two Joni Mitchell songs?

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,590
Let me switch back, get switch and I can switch branches using get crackin or gooey so I can switch

33
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,880
this way if you prefer.

34
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,580
And now in my terminal I type get status.

35
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:21,090
It does say I'm on oldies, so I prefer to use terminal, but I like to use get crackin to help visualize

36
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,840
this stuff.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,860
Anyway, I'm going to add to Joni Mitchell songs.

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,620
There we are, river and both sides now.

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,790
Great songs.

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,610
I will add those changes and commit.

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,720
So get commit dash a dash m and I could do this from within.

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,460
Get cracking if I wanted to.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,440
Over here.

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,730
View the change.

45
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,780
I can stage that file and then I can make my commit message.

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,100
Add to Joni Mitchell songs.

47
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,020
It's the exact same thing.

48
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,380
Whoops.

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,340
I mean to.

50
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,720
It's just I'm doing it from a gooey.

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,910
So I stage that file I commit and I'm on the branch oldies, so let's do that.

52
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,480
Okay, so now we see this is where Master was.

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,470
It still is.

54
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,460
But oldies now has two new commits that master does not have.

55
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,920
So this sets us up for what we've already seen a fast forward merge.

56
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,370
If I want to merge the changes from oldies into master, it's pretty straightforward.

57
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,540
All we need to do is add these two commits to master.

58
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,040
Well, it's not what we do, but it's what git does.

59
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,110
It just catches up, catches up to the top, so it's in sync with oldies.

60
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,330
So again, this is master right now.

61
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,830
This is oldies.

62
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,740
There's two commits on oldies that master does not have.

63
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,170
I'm going to merge them.

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,190
So what does that process like again?

65
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,420
Well, it's two steps.

66
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,750
Remember, we go to the destination branch and then we merge with Git Merge and our branch name.

67
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:54,280
So I'm going to switch to Master OC now I'm going to run, get merge and then oldies.

68
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,710
So before I hit enter just one more time, these two commits wings and Joni Mitchell.

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,130
Those two bands are two groups that I added songs for.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,410
Those commits are now going to be added to master, or another way of thinking of it is just master

71
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,290
is going to fast forward and catch up with those two commits.

72
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,280
So here we go.

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,510
Fast forward and you can see over here now master and oldest are both referring to the same commit.

74
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,810
So that's visualizing a fast forward merge.

75
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,200
But as I've alluded to, not every merge is a fast forward.

76
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,400
And in the next video, we will deliberately create a situation that is not as simple.

77
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,440
We'll have to merge and there may be some issues that arise.

78
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,380
So that's coming up.
