1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,600
Okay.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,939
So hopefully after the last section you're now familiar with branching and the basic branch commands

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,170
like Git branch and get switch.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,490
We're now going to see how we can combine changes between branches, how we can merge branches into

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,210
one another.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,650
So very important to understand branches before we can talk about merging them.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,730
This section, there's really not a whole lot of different concepts that we cover.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,490
It all has to do with merging branches and there are a few types of merges.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,870
There's one called a fast forward merge.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm going to put that in critical as well as the get merge command that I'm going to show you and the

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,420
merge commits or merge commits that are generated from merge.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,680
In some scenarios, it's really the only command I show you in this section.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,340
But the probably the trickiest area is something called merge conflicts and learning how to resolve

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,790
them.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,110
So I've put that in yellow.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,450
It's not impossibly difficult or anything like that, but there's just some new things we need to talk

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,810
about when we try and merge changes together.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,430
There's conflicts, how do we resolve them?

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,650
Get might get angry or might panic.

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,510
So how do we fix that situation?

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,810
All critical then the one thing that will go in nice to have you could totally skip this.

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,990
I show how to use vs code the text editor that I like to use it has some built in functionality to help

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,190
us resolve conflicts.

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,380
Totally nice to have but you would be fine.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,090
Never seeing that video as well.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,160
So concept wise, there's not all that much going on in this section, but the stuff that is going on

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,060
is all critical.

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,420
Take your time going through it, follow along, get some practice.

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,160
And this is one of those last critical sections where, you know, after this you'll have a foundation

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,480
that you need to work with it.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,520
And then everything else that we add on top will be important or nice to have, but not a whole bunch

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,650
more critical stuff until we get to GitHub.
