1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,480
All right.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,050
So next up, I'd like to show another example of resolving conflicts.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,800
But this time I'm going to show you how to do it using VTS code.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,470
So VTS code has some nice built in functionality to help you resolve conflicts or it can help in some

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,190
scenarios.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,780
So I'm just going to come up with another situation that will cause a merge conflict.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,770
What I'm going to do is go to my master branch, which I'm currently on.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,740
We'll ignore the combo, the Serena, the Bjorn branches.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,060
For now, I'm going to go to the master branch and I'm going to make a new branch from here.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,780
So currently on Master, we just have four songs and three podcasts in the podcast file, so I'm going

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,950
to make a new branch.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,390
Let's do get switch.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,020
You know what?

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:48,600
Why don't I just to be different, I'll use git checkout, dash b if you remember, this is another

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,910
way of making a branch and switching to it.

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,500
It's the old way of doing it before get switch.

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,090
It's Dash B to make the branch and switch to it.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,650
It's kind of confusing.

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,950
The alternative is get switch dash c.

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,660
Anyway, I might be screwing you over by mixing and matching them.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,110
I don't know.

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,780
Maybe I'm.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,030
I'm telling myself it's better to expose you to them so that you see the different options.

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,410
But maybe it's just confusing.

25
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,250
I apologize.

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,430
Anyway, this branch is going to be called.

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,240
How about, I don't know, silence?

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:22,960
Okay.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,120
So get check out Dash be silence and this playlist.

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,610
The person who wants silence.

31
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,480
They're going to go to their playlist and remove everything.

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,360
All songs and all podcasts like that.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,440
And they're going to add and commit.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,720
So get add.

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,330
Let's just add dot get commit.

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,330
Empty podcasts and songs files.

37
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,710
All right, so that's our first half, right?

38
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,090
We have our branch silence that we basically just emptied everything out of.

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,260
We still have the files.

40
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:11,070
So then I'm going to switch back to Master, get switch master and what should we do?

41
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,470
Let's add a podcast.

42
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:21,840
So the lead Radiolab, This American Life one I like recently is Recipe Club and another one is Broken

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,800
Record, a great music podcast, and then we'll add a song in here.

44
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,120
Should we do another Abba song about Waterloo by ABBA?

45
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,300
All right, so I'm going to add and commit those get add dot, get commit.

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,760
Let's just go with, I don't know something generic add podcasts and songs.

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,520
It's not a very it's not a good commit message at all, but just keeping it quick and simple.

48
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,380
Okay, so this is where we stand now on my master branch.

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,350
I have this new commit add podcast in songs.

50
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,520
Right?

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,510
I added this right here, Waterloo by ABBA and these two podcasts.

52
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,120
But before I did that, I branched off and that's where we created our branch called Silence.

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,050
And on the Silence Branch, I did one thing and one thing only, which was I emptied out those two files.

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,370
So I have a new commit on silence and I have a new commit on master.

55
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,640
I'm going to try and merge them and as we know, that should generate a conflict because it's not as

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,000
simple as a fast forward and get can't figure out automatically how to merge these because we edited

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,870
this podcast file both on this branch and on the Silence branch and we did the same thing for the songs

58
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,380
file.

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,290
So if I want to merge in the Silence branch to master, I'll check get status.

60
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,500
Okay we're good to go get merge silence.

61
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,690
And now we have an example where we have two files with conflicts.

62
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,580
So that's another thing I wanted to demonstrate.

63
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,620
You're not always just going to get one file.

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Sometimes you can get a whole bunch of files, especially if, well, we can address that later.

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,280
If things have gone wrong or you're you're not really getting your coworkers code as frequently as you

66
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,000
should.

67
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,460
Let's say you do a whole bunch of work for like a year, and then you come back to the office and you

68
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,720
try and merge things into master.

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,850
It's not going to go well anyway.

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,360
Two files with conflicts, songs and podcasts.

71
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,070
Automatic Merge failed, fix them and then add and commit.

72
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,900
So I wanted to show how to do this with VS code where there's a built in interface.

73
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,590
So most editors, code editors have some support for this.

74
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,970
This is really nice if you have to resolve conflicts, we don't have to manually go and delete everything,

75
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,480
right?

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,540
If I if I want to accept silence, if that's what I want on this branch, I merge in the changes from

77
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,660
silence and I want the silence version.

78
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,610
So the empty files I can click accept incoming change.

79
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,880
This is the incoming change or I can accept the current change.

80
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,800
What we already have on Master or I can accept both changes which is not going to look like anything

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,550
because silence, as you can see, there's nothing here.

82
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,830
We deleted it right on that branch.

83
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,510
We committed an empty file.

84
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,630
So in each of these files where there's a conflict, I could go about it manually, delete these markers

85
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,670
myself, choose what I want, or I can just accept incoming change.

86
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,540
So it does it for me.

87
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,280
Not that impressive because it just deletes what was in there, but that's only because our incoming

88
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,780
branch was empty in this file.

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,030
So I could do that.

90
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,520
Or if I wanted to, I can put anything in here.

91
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,040
Just I can add changes in here.

92
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,010
Silence and save that and add and commit.

93
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,940
It's totally up to me.

94
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,310
I'm not limited to just either or.

95
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,040
Sometimes when you're resolving conflicts, you may need to go in and add additional code or a comment

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,360
to explain something.

97
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,660
So it's not always just a binary, this one, that one.

98
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,980
Sometimes there's a bit of a grey area, so I'm going to accept the incoming change again.

99
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,860
Or maybe I'll just show you if you click Accept Current Change.

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,090
We end up with what we currently had on Master, but I'm going to delete that.

101
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,790
We've now gone to silence in both of them.

102
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,260
We merged in those changes that was coming from our Silence branch.

103
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,660
And now I can go over to my terminal.

104
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,020
Oh, by the way, here, the guy also shows me that there's conflicts, and specifically it will even

105
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,560
show me where the conflicts are, and I guess I can resolve them here.

106
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,010
I've never used get cracking to do that, but it's kind of cool.

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,030
Anyway, I'm going to go to my terminal and get status.

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,680
We have those two files we modified, so I'm going to add them and get commit and just do something

109
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,410
like merge silence branch.

110
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,830
And there we go.

111
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,380
Now we take a look at the guy and we can see we merge that silence branch into master.

112
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,780
And with that merge it doesn't look like much because our files are both empty.

113
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,450
But that did indeed come from the Silence branch.

114
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,100
We still have this whole history on Master, a whole bunch of commits that came before it.

115
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,190
You can see that with git log, write all these commits and then we have merge silence branch and we

116
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,380
can see empty podcasts and songs files.

117
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,950
That is the commit that came from the Silence branch right there.

118
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,340
So that's just another example of resolving conflicts.

119
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,750
In this case, we had two files that we resolved.

120
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,800
You can have, I mean, as many as there are.

121
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,090
There's no limit on that.

122
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,610
And we fix them all in the same way.

123
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,940
You open each one up, figure out what you want to keep, keep the incoming branch changes, the current

124
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,410
branch changes or both.

125
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,860
Save your files and then make that new commit to merge them OC.
