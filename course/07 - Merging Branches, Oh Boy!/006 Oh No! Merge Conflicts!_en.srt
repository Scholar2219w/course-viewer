1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,870
All right.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,090
So now we get to talk about merge conflicts.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,030
When we merge two branches, as we've seen get, we'll do its best to automatically merge those changes,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,190
whether it's a fast forward or needs to make a merge commit as we saw in the last video, it tries to

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,470
do things automatically and so far it's succeeded in the two examples I've shown you.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:27,000
But if we had conflicting changes, for example, on one branch, somebody modified a file and on a

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,360
second branch that we're merging, somebody deleted the same file.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:38,940
Or another situation would be if on one branch I edit one line 77 of some file and somebody else on

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,810
the other branch.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,090
Or maybe it's me two on the other branch.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,180
I edit the same line line 77 in the same file get doesn't know how to automatically merge that.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,060
How does it decide what to keep and what to get rid of?

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,370
So this is where merge conflicts come up.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,290
You have to manually resolve them.

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,370
It's not a big deal.

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,350
Let me show you the process first.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,830
When you run git merge and if there are conflicts you'll see something like this conflict and then merge

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,220
conflict in some file automatic merge failed, fix the conflicts and then commit the result.

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,010
So this is a multi step process.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,210
Get tells us there's conflicts, then we have to go and open the files where there are conflicts and

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,150
fix them and then we commit those changes.

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,740
So the files where there are conflicts are actually decorated.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,480
They, they have new content to indicate where there are conflicts.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,630
So when we open up a file, we'll see this weird stuff in their head and then a branch name.

25
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,950
I will show a demo of this, of course, so it should make more sense than it does at the moment.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:51,270
So what these markers indicate is what content came from my head branch, the branch I'm on, the recipient

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,060
branch I'm trying to merge into, and that's indicated by the less than the little arrow head and then

28
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,050
the equal sign.

29
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,310
So this is what I had in this diagram on my, let's say the master branch.

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,870
This is the change I made.

31
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,759
And then this is from the bug fixed branch that I'm trying to merge in.

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,260
So it's my job now to delete or keep both, figure out which part I want, which part I don't want.

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,190
It's totally up to me.

34
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,890
I resolve it and then I get rid of these conflict markers, these symbols, and then I save the file

35
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,730
and then I go back and add and commit the changes.

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,590
So here's a step by step guide.

37
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,190
You run into a conflict, get tells you what files there are conflicts in.

38
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,370
We open up those files, then we edit the files.

39
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,460
We figure out how do we want to resolve the conflict?

40
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,560
Do I want all three lines?

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,230
Do I want just these two or just this one?

42
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,570
You combine them, it's up to you, right?

43
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,890
And with code, usually you need to figure out what matters and what's supposed to be there.

44
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,590
And you know, you have to go through it and be careful.

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,480
But the point is you're doing it as a human get is not just deciding for you.

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,550
So it's very important we go through, we remove those conflicts, we decide what we want to keep,

47
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,410
and then we remove the markers.

48
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,600
As I mentioned, we get rid of this, we get rid of this and we get rid of this save.

49
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,050
Now we add our changes and make a commit and we're done.

50
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,580
We resolve the conflict.

51
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,780
So I know it seems complicated, but I'm going to show a demo in the next video.
