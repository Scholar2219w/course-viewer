1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,540
So let's start the section off with a nice and easy topic.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,100
The get docs.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:12,630
Yes, this is a very funny joke because these are pictures of doctors, but we're not actually talking

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,590
about doctors.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,920
We're talking about the git documentation.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,250
Can you believe how funny that is?

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,980
So dumb jokes aside, we're talking about the git documentation which you may want to reference at some

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,150
point if you have questions or you want to learn more about one of the commands that I'm showing you.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,910
So the docs are accessible at Git Dash Semco.

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,670
I never remember that.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,730
I just Google get and then I end up on this web page and then we want to go to documentation pretty

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,510
much every time.

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,270
That's where I go, you know, I'm not going to about I don't need to see the advantages of get to compare

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,230
it to something else.

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm already using it.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,700
I just want the docs.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,730
Now there are a couple of sections here and most of the time I end up looking at the reference manual.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,720
Occasionally this book called Pro get pretty much never the videos, so the reference manual will start.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,819
There is exactly what it says.

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,740
It's a reference manual to all the git commands and main topics.

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,060
It is not ordered.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,120
It's not a step by step guide, it's just a reference.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,050
So for example, we've been using get commit.

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,640
If I want to learn more about Git commits, I can click on this, I'll zoom in.

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,500
It tells us roughly what it does.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,420
Record changes to the repository.

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:33,350
Here's a more detailed description, but then as I scroll down, this is what I end up looking at occasionally

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,930
on the docs, all of these options.

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:42,440
So this is one command get commit and we've used one option which is dash m could find that on here

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,250
somewhere.

31
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:50,600
Dash M which is short for dash dash message, use the given message as the commit message.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,040
We already know that.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,420
Hopefully you know how to do that, but here is where we would find that information.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,730
So there are lots of options for every single one of the git commands I've shown you and it's honestly

35
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,630
overwhelming.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,740
I use very few of them, but there are a lot available.

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,080
So if you ever have questions about them, if you see somebody use a command, get commit and then the

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,340
Dash Z flag and you have no idea what that is, you can read about it here.

39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,680
Also, if we keep scrolling down, we will find examples.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,600
So there are some examples that show how to use get commit in this example.

41
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,640
But on another page, if we're looking at git log, that will be examples for git log or for some of

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,830
the more advanced commands that can be helpful.

43
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,840
And that's pretty much it.

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,230
I mean, there's discussion down at the bottom basically for every git command, we deal with this really

45
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,700
thorough but also intimidating set of documentation.

46
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:54,740
So if you are looking for something more educational or more sort of techy, you can go to the book

47
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,180
and this is grouped into topics that are ordered and it explains things.

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,890
So for example, we haven't yet covered branching, but if you wanted to learn more about branching

49
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,920
or if my explanation is insufficient, once you get to that section, you can read more and have diagrams

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,140
and sort of step by step explanation here.

51
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,910
And it's pretty I shouldn't say pretty.

52
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,170
It's very well written.

53
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:24,800
It's a well done book and it is a nice antidote to the dry and purely reference manual documentation.

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,340
The book really does have a clear path through it, so I don't necessarily recommend reading the entire

55
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,930
book, but I mean, I come here occasionally when I have questions about things, some commands that

56
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,770
I haven't used in a while or configuring things.

57
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,380
The book is very helpful to explain them.

58
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,300
And then if you just have a one off question about what is that flag or is there a way to do X with

59
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,800
the git log command?

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,260
You can go read about it on the reference manual.

61
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,130
Just do your best to stay sane while reading these docs.

62
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,460
There are so many options, so many flags for every single command.

63
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,770
All right, so that's how we get to the docs.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,320
Get them documentation, reference, manual or book.
