1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,900
Next up, totally optional.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,860
Like most of this section just has to do with committing.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,240
I'm going to show you how to make a commit using a gooey like get crackin.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,700
And even if you're not interested in using a gooey, I still think, you know, it's worth checking

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,090
out because these guys can help show you your commits.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,890
They help you visualize things.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,300
But also, it's nice to know that, you know, there are different ways of interacting with Git and

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,830
at the end of the day we're still just working with that Git folder.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,930
It's just a different interface, a different way of interacting with it.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,460
So I'm using Git Crack in.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,300
I had a whole video on this early on where I talked about how to install it.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,230
It's very simple.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,110
You download it for free and that's kind of it.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,600
And I'm just going to open up this repo that we've been working in my first novel.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,460
So if you have any repo you've created by now, whether it's from an exercise or you're following along,

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,120
you have your own novel, whatever it is, we can open it with git cracking.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,620
So here's get cracking.

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm going to go to open a new repository.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,140
So if you open it up for the first time, it will probably look like this.

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,630
It will ask you to open a repository.

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,750
And then here is that folder I navigated to.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Sorry, I can't zoom in easily, but I just found my repository.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,430
So that same folder, my first novel and I'm going to open it.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,020
And there we are.

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,660
We see my commit history right here.

26
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,410
So right now we're just visualizing the commits.

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,510
This is basically what we see with a git log.

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,010
Unfortunately, it's not letting me zoom in much more either, but I hope you can see that.

29
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,320
So we have our first one start work on outline and main characters all the way up to remove extra blank

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,520
lines in chapter two.

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,590
But what I want to show you is how we make a new commit.

32
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,110
So right now, our working tree is clean.

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,370
I haven't made any changes at this point.

34
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,360
I haven't diverged for what from what Git has committed, as you can see.

35
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,980
But let's make some changes.

36
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,270
What should we do?

37
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,330
I'm going to add some more to the characters file.

38
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,510
So I just added some information about Myrtle Wilson.

39
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,730
And here's some more information about George Wilson, two characters in The Great Gatsby that come

40
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,080
up in Chapter two.

41
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,800
All right.

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,910
So I'm going to save that.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,030
And also, how about I add something to our moodboard?

44
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,580
So I have these images in here.

45
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,120
Let's add another image.

46
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,480
Okay.

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,270
So I downloaded two more images, one of alcohol and one of a billboard thematically related in some

48
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,320
way to The Great Gatsby.

49
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,730
They're part of my mood board and both also licensed for me to use.

50
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,330
So I'm going to add those both into this mood board folder.

51
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,810
So I've made a couple of changes and obviously I shouldn't say obviously, but hopefully you're aware

52
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,150
that I could check to see, you know, my status by using Git status and I would see that we modified

53
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,870
characters that text and that there are two new files in mood board which are not being tracked, but

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,890
this video is about using the goofy.

55
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,460
If we take a look at the gooey, I get this message.

56
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,610
It says three file changes in working directory so I can click here to view those file changes or I

57
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,650
can just click here where it says Work in progress and I wish I could make this larger.

58
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:12,890
But what we see is unstaged files, characters that text and then Mood Board, bar and mood board billboard

59
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,970
the two images and you'll see that there's a little icon here with a pencil.

60
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,880
That means I modified or edited that file.

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,630
And here, this little plus sign means it's a new file.

62
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,060
So I want to make a commit first.

63
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,070
How about just with the characters changes?

64
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,210
So I want to stage characters, so I'm going to click stage.

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,040
So at this point I have staged that one file and actually if I type get status over here, what do we

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,790
see changes to be committed characters text.

67
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:50,870
So it was the same exact thing as me typing get add characters, but instead I clicked stage and then

68
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,160
I'm going to make my commit.

69
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,590
So this first commit is just characters.

70
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:01,130
So I add my commit message right there or I can type it over here and to my message will be something

71
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,430
like Add Wilson's.

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,690
Well since two characters list or.

73
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,650
Yeah, that's fine.

74
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,520
Add the Wilsons.

75
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,850
Maybe the Wilsons.

76
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,190
So added two of them.

77
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,120
All right.

78
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,150
And then I'll commit changes to that one file.

79
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,960
And we see a new commit here.

80
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,840
Add the Wilsons to character list and if I type get status.

81
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,860
We now made it commit.

82
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,660
We don't have this character test staged anymore and if I type get log.

83
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,830
There it is.

84
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,960
Add the Wilsons to characters list.

85
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,040
So let's do a second commit now with the mood board changes.

86
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:50,240
So I'm going to stage that new bar image and the billboard image, and then I group them together by

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,270
staging them and I'll make my commit.

88
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,180
You know, I don't know.

89
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,900
Add.

90
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,560
More.

91
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,900
How about expand?

92
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,880
Add to images to mood board or something like that?

93
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,910
Nothing amazing.

94
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,940
But here's where I write that commit message and here's where I commit.

95
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,910
Before I do that, what do you expect me to see when I type get status?

96
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,560
This is what we typed or what we saw before to untracked files.

97
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,800
But now they're both going to be committed.

98
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,550
They are both staged because I clicked the stage button.

99
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,430
So same process, just a different interface.

100
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:34,800
I made changes, then I click to stage and I click to commit or I use get add to stage and get commit

101
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,700
to commit.

102
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,860
All righty.

103
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,110
So I'm going to click commit changes to two files.

104
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,860
And there we are.

105
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,760
We have a new commit show up.

106
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,850
And if I do get logged, let's do our one line.

107
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,740
There it is.

108
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,450
Add two images to mood board.

109
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,550
Add the Wilsons to Character List.

110
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,430
So that's just a quick intro to using a tool like Get Cracking.

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,200
Of course, the interface changes if you're using a different app like Source Tree or what else is there?

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,120
What tower get tower.

113
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,890
There's a couple of them I can't remember.

114
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,300
They all are similar though.

115
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,420
You click to stage and then you click to commit.

116
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,890
You type a message in and this is just a nice educational tool.

117
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:21,980
Honestly, especially when we get to branching and merging, the diagrams over here are really helpful,

118
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,950
but at this point it's just another way of doing what we already know how to do.
