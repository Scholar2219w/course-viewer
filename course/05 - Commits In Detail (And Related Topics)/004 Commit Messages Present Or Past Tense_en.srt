00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,900
Next up, a quick video on commit messages and which tense, present or past tense you should use while

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,380
writing them?

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,820
And does it even matter?

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,560
This is kind of a weird thing and get it always baffled me when I was starting out.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,700
But the git documentation officially recommends that you use present tense imperative style commit messages.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:32,549
So present tense meaning verbs like make something or change x fix x instead of past tense fixed changed

7
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,540
updated.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,290
So imperative style though or the imperative mood is best illustrated probably by the quote from the

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,400
documentation.

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,770
Describe your changes in imperative mood.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:54,240
Make Zizzi do frosts instead of makes zizzi do frost's or I changed zizzi to do Frost's right things

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,570
as if you're giving orders to the code base to change its behavior.

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,690
Personally, I always found this weird.

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,800
I still do.

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,600
Even if I follow this a lot of the time, it just doesn't seem natural to me.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,040
You don't have to do this.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,150
Of course, this is all just convention, just a practice you can get in the habit of.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,250
There's a lot of debate over this, but again, this is sort of the official recommendation from the

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,060
Get Docs.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,070
Here's a blog post written by Eumir Gaspar where he talks about the two.

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,600
Well, I guess there's more than two options, but the two common options using the present tense or

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,520
the past tense and the present tense, as we've already talked about, is what get recommends.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,800
And one of the main reasons people use it is that it actually generates its own messages.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,320
At some point when we talk about merging, it will generate a commit message that looks like this merge,

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,630
pull, request, blah blah blah.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,010
So it says merge in present tense.

27
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,700
But honestly, in my opinion I kind of feel like past tense makes more sense to me because you're making

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,800
a commit with the work that you have done.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,630
It's finished, you're committing it.

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,600
But honestly, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter.

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,000
As long as you are consistent, or more importantly, as long as you're following the pattern set out

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,280
by whatever organization you're working with, if it's a company or an open source project, if everyone

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,300
else is doing present tense and they ask you to do present tense, you should do present tense.

34
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,210
So I try and stick with present tense when I'm teaching.

35
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:26,670
If we type git log the commit messages I have been writing our split exe or rename or create or begin.

36
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,680
So those are present tense imperative, but the community is somewhat split on this.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,580
If you look at this popular StackOverflow post from ten years ago, the top answer says you definitely

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,810
should use present tense.

39
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,910
But then the second answer says you should almost always use the past tense.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,770
So that's number one.

41
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,290
And number two directly in conflict.

42
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,170
Anyway, this video is going on longer than it needs to.

43
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,780
I just wanted to make that point that in the real world you'll likely come across present tense, imperative

44
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,800
commit messages.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,090
And as I mentioned, you don't have to follow this pattern, especially in your own personal use.

46
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,520
But if you're working at a company or on an open source project, definitely pay attention to the guidelines

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,840
for writing commit messages.
