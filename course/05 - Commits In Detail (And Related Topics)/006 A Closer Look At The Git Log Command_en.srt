00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,930
In this video.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,130
I want to talk about the docs one more time and specifically how we can learn more about git log, which

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,520
just gives us a log of the commits in a given repository.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,940
And as we saw when I added a very, very long commit message, we see the entire thing here.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,510
Now shortly we will want to see these commits and specifically we're going to want to know these commit

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,350
hashes.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,580
Spoiler.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,140
We need those in order to revisit a commit or undo a commit or check out or take a look at a commit.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,380
So we need those.

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,140
And if we have hundreds of commits and they all have these really long messages, that could be really

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,950
frustrating.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,420
So there are some options for how we use git log.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,890
So let's go to the documentation, let's go to reference and we'll find log.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,480
Here it is.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,150
I'll zoom in a bit.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,630
As we know it shows us commit logs, but there's quite a bit to how it works and there's a lot that

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,099
I just don't know about it because I don't use most of these features.

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,890
Just like with most Git commands, there are tons of options, but the one I'm interested in for now

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,100
we scroll down, could also find it in the examples.

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm pretty sure down at the bottom.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,200
I mean, look at this.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,950
This is crazy.

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,200
The number of options just absurd.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,420
You can filter things out based on who wrote the commits when they were committed.

25
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,880
I believe you can order them differently.

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,980
But what we are after.

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:30,670
All right.

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,290
Well, I had to search for it, but this is what we're after.

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:40,330
Formatting the commits these flags including dash dash pretty allow us to pretty print or change the

30
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:46,780
format of the logs how they're printed out and specifically I usually use this option one line.

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,530
So dash dash one line which is actually shorthand for dash dash pretty equals one line dash dash abbrev

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,490
commit.

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,140
So what does this mean?

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,830
We can just take one piece at a time just to show you a brief commit.

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,640
Just shows us a shorter version of that commit hash.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,460
So if I do get log dash, dash a brief commit, it's hard to see much of a difference.

37
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:15,490
But here I'm only getting a small piece compared to what we got before of each one of those commit hashes,

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,430
but we're actually after a bit more than that.

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,320
We want one line.

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,460
So when we do dash, dash pretty equals one line, we have these different options for pretty dash,

41
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,450
dash, pretty medium or fuller email.

42
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,570
These are all things that we can format in the response.

43
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,430
But I just wanted to show you one line.

44
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,880
So I like to use the shorthand dash dash one line, but just know that it's actually shorthand for pretty

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,430
equal to one line and abbreviated commit.

46
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,480
Let me just show that jet lag dash, dash one line if I can type it correctly.

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,660
And there we go.

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,990
Oh, it's so much better.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,900
Look at that.

50
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,420
You can see one line of each commit message, which is why your first line of a commit message, even

51
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,330
if it's a super long one, the first line should explain.

52
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,860
It should summarize the commit.

53
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,630
So remove extra blank lines.

54
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,620
That's what we did.

55
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,510
Even though if we actually look at the entire message, there's a whole bunch of other stuff.

56
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,560
It's very important or I shouldn't say very important, but it's conventional.

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,440
And you should follow this pattern of having that first line, be the summary of the commit and then

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,890
any other information comes afterwards separated by a return.

59
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,420
So git log, dash, dash one line.

60
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,900
It's a nice way to look at our history, and it's not just about remembering, Oh, that was such a

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,010
cute message I wrote.

62
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,040
It's actually important to be able to do this because shortly we will be revisiting commits and we want

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,760
to look at this history so that we can figure out where to time travel back to.

64
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,270
But for now we're just reminiscing, so let's get logged.

65
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,900
The docs, as I just showed you, are so overwhelming.

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,060
I mean, there's so much you can do with git log.

67
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,680
I have carpal tunnel just from scrolling down this page, so don't feel intimidated or do feel intimidated,

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,120
but know that I am also intimidated by this page, whichever makes you more comfortable.
