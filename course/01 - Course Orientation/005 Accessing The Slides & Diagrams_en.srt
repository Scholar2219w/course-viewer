1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,750
One more quick note about the course.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,150
I made a lot of diagrams in slides, and I'm sure some of you will want access to them yourself.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,240
You can find the slides for every single section that has them, which is pretty much every section

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,400
attached to the first video.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,710
So the very first video in each section is always titled What Really Matters in this section.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,990
And it's a video where I walk through the different topics that I cover and I sort them into critical,

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,610
important, and nice to have.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,530
And just give you a heads up about don't stress about this and do worry about this.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,300
So attached to each one of those videos at the beginning of a section, there's a resource that says

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,010
slides for this section.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,660
So you'll see that here.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,880
Here's the installation slides.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,290
And you have access to them, right?

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,370
The different commands.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,980
And the same holds true for all of the different sections.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:55,130
So if you want to learn more about the slides for working with GitHub, go to that first video in the

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,330
section, slides in the resources, and here you are.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,820
OC So that's all I want to say.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,560
First video of every section.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,180
I explain what matters in that section, but also that's where you find the slides for the rest of that

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,840
section.
