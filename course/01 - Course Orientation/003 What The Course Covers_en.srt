1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,019
So next up, I'd like to talk about the course curriculum and what we cover.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:10,290
And I'll try to break it down into some smaller pieces because on the surface we cover quite a few topics

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,120
related to Git and GitHub.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:18,780
So there's always a pressure honestly in these courses to fit as many related topics as possible into

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,160
a course just to compete or to stand out in some way.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,510
And I can't ignore that, but I do want to try my best to make it very clear what actually matters and

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,920
what is fundamental, because not all of this stuff you see in front of you and there's likely to be

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,630
more by the time you're actually watching this, there will be more videos or more additional sections

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,150
added towards the end because students request them.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,360
But anyway, not all of these are critical.

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,460
So there's a couple of chunks, I guess that I would I would break things down into the first bit is

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,840
all about the core functionality of Git working with the very, very basics.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,390
Things like adding and committing and creating repositories get logged, get status, creating branches,

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,820
checking out, switching, merging.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,160
That is your core git toolbox.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,220
And then we talk about I'm calling it next level git, but it's not crazy difficult stuff.

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,880
It's just a couple of git topics that won't come up as often.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,080
They're not part of your day to day get life, but they still are very important.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,200
So we talk about defying the git diff, command stashing, and then we talk about quite a few ways of

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,960
time traveling and git or undoing changes.

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,860
Get revert, get reset, get restored, undoing changes and going back to old work and detaching and

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,180
reattaching the head.

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,640
And there's quite a bit of stuff in that section.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,210
So it's important, but it's just not part of this Git core.

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,290
Then we move on to GitHub and collaboration.

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,600
So I've grouped together four sections here.

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,010
I don't really have a nice title for it, but we basically learn about the basics of GitHub, working

28
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,090
with GitHub, getting our code up on GitHub, getting stuff down from GitHub.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,120
We talk about things like GitHub pages and GitHub gists and collaboration workflows.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,550
That's a very significant chunk of this course.

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,770
We spend a lot of time on that, talking about the different ways that you could use Git with a team

32
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,570
to collaborate along with GitHub and different structures, different strategies you can employ.

33
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,230
There's not just one way and they all have some certain strengths and weaknesses.

34
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,110
So I demonstrate those and spend a lot of time talking about it.

35
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,340
It's pretty important stuff.

36
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:30,540
So I've grouped that together with GitHub and then after that it's kind of just a mixture of other Git

37
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,210
stuff that I felt compelled to include.

38
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,510
And these are some of the more advanced topics or the niche topics.

39
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,570
So this includes things like rebasing, cleaning up your git history with interactive rebasing, squashing,

40
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,640
dropping, fixing up all sorts of sort of fun parts, in my opinion.

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,800
We talk about tags, we talk about how it works behind the scenes and hashing.

42
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,210
We cover things like get objects, get blobs, get trees.

43
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,890
So there's stuff in here that you could go your whole life as a get user without knowing.

44
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,100
I think it's worth giving you the option at least to check it out.

45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,620
If you're curious, we talk about creating custom aliases and shortcuts and ref logs.

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,550
That's a fun one.

47
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,630
I'm happy with how that section turned out and as I said, there's likely to be more.

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,220
If you scroll down right now through the curriculum, there's likely more content in the course that's

49
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,330
not included here.

50
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,300
So to recap this, there's quite a bit and it's all getting GitHub oriented, but there's this first

51
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,060
chunk that is the core of Git on its own.

52
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,240
Then we talk about some next level Git topics that are absolutely important to know, but they're not

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,150
part of your typical hour to hour or day to day use case for Git or they might not be.

54
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,120
And then we talk about GitHub and collaboration workflows and then it's just a bunch of other Git related

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,850
topics at the end that I had a lot of fun recording.

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,530
Okay, so let's get started.
