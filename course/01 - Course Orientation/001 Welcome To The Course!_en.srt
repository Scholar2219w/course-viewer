00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,040
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,540
Me and some of my stock asset friends here are very happy to welcome you to the Git and GitHub boot

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,110
camp.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,840
So none of these people are my real friends, but they are free images from my slide software, which

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,980
is pretty good too, and they'll be making some appearances throughout the course in my diagrams.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,620
Anyway, none of these fine folks are actually me.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,640
This is me here.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,420
Hello, everyone.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,770
My name is Colt Steele.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,140
I never know how much detail to go into in my background, but I'll say that I've been teaching people

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,820
how to program for almost a decade.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,320
I've helped thousands of people change careers in my in-person bootcamps, but I've also reached over

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,940
a million students online.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,800
I always feel a bit weird talking about it, but you can always check out my LinkedIn or my instructor

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,510
bio if you want more information.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,990
All that really matters is that I actually really enjoy teaching it.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,760
It's a challenging thing to teach and it's a it's a creative challenge for the teacher.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,230
So I hope you enjoy the course.

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,100
I've spent a lot of time trying to make it the best possible course.

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,040
So if you're watching this, you probably already know that Git is this amazing, universal, wide spread

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:09,240
tool that, along with GitHub, enables and empowers millions and millions of users and companies ranging

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,580
from tiny startups all the way up to Fortune 50 companies, to build things together, to collaborate

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,560
and to maintain applications.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,060
So you probably already know that.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,260
And a lot of people know it.

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,340
They know it's crucial, yet it often goes ignored.

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,730
It's not the most glamorous topic to learn at the beginning.

28
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:34,530
I totally get why a lot of people prioritize learning JavaScript or CSS or Python or pretty much anything

29
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,430
over Git.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,220
But the truth is, this is a very annoying expression that the best time to learn Git is.

31
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,190
Yesterday somebody told me something very similar.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,200
A neighbor actually about how the best time to plant fruit trees is five years ago.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,810
When you hear something like that, it's it's natural to want to punch that person, strangle them,

34
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,550
or maybe just roll your eyes.

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,710
But there is some truth to this.

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,260
But also there's another piece to that sentence.

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,390
The second best time to learn Git is now.

38
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,670
The second best time to plant fruit trees is today.

39
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,539
Probably the second best time to plant fruit trees was four years ago.

40
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,180
Anyway, the point is that it's very important to try and learn Git as soon as possible along whatever

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,200
journey you're on.

42
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,210
The sooner you learn it, the better.

43
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,070
Because it's not just about learning some syntax that takes some time.

44
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,050
But you know, you can watch a video or a course or read a book and and learn the basics.

45
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,220
But it takes more work.

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,800
There's more than just learning the basic syntax.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,730
The real work comes with part two, or what I'm calling step two.

48
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,970
Actually living as a get user and breathing git.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,160
It needs to become second nature get becomes a fundamental part of your workflow.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,270
So that takes time.

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,540
That's why the best time to learn get is yesterday, blah blah blah.

52
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,030
But also that's the goal of this course to help get become second nature.

53
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,050
So not just to teach you the basics, it's also helping you just learn and live, get, breathe, get

54
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,280
in as a user.

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,350
And that takes time and it takes practice.

56
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,210
So that's why this course is more than just a bunch of lectures, although it's a ton of lectures,

57
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,880
obviously I can't get around that.

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,700
That is one of the core pieces of the course.

59
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,750
It has to be educational.

60
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,220
There's going to be that explaining the syntax and demonstrating how things work.

61
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,500
But also there are quite a few exercises that I built to try and force you to get practice, to try

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,140
and sort of steer you towards becoming one with gifts.

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
So I highly recommend you do those.

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,130
I'll point them out in a separate video.

65
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,080
I want to talk about some strategies for them.

66
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:43,470
I also tried to make it somewhat interesting and entertaining, but also visually I spent way too much

67
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:43,740
time.

68
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,220
I think making diagrams and get is something that I think benefits a lot from thinking about in a visual

69
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,640
way.

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,530
So I spent a lot of time making these diagrams.

71
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,340
I hope you appreciate them, and I guess that's really all I have to say right now.

72
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,600
Welcome to the course, everyone.

73
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,950
I hope you enjoy it and I'll end this welcome video with one not at all important note in my courses

74
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,350
I often reference my pet chickens.

75
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,200
Throughout my courses, I'll use their names in different files or in exercises and diagrams, and students

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,960
inevitably demand photos or videos of my chickens.

77
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,810
So I'm just going to get it out of the way here if you want to see them.

78
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,649
Here they are.

79
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,760
All right.

80
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,770
So we'll go ahead and get started once again.

81
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,190
Welcome.

82
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,540
And I hope you enjoyed the course.
