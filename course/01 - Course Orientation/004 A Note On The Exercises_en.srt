00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,420
Next up, I'd like to talk a little bit about the exercises in the course.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:10,140
A very important piece, easy to overlook as a student, but I think are very important to really understanding

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,080
and living and breathing gibt you have to practice it.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,460
It's not just the syntax.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,000
So throughout the course there are exercises sprinkled in.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,640
And I have to be honest, creating these exercises is not always that easy because unlike other things

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,550
that I teach, CSS or JavaScript or Python where I can ask students to make something and very clearly

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,590
set out, here are the expectations.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,630
Make this thing with Git.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,750
It's not really about making things, it's about the workflows.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,500
So I had to get pretty creative and I tried my best to come up with exercises.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,180
I'm pretty happy with how they turned out.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,870
I just want to show you where to find them and the basics of how they work.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,440
So the exercises are at the end of sections.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,530
So for example, this is a section intro to GitHub.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,770
The very last video is GitHub Basics Exercise or here's undoing changes in history.

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,770
The last video is Undoing Changes Exercise.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,160
So there are videos where I explain the exercise.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,380
I mute this here, so I explain how it works and what I'm expecting you to do, and then I go ahead

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,570
and do it myself, sort of a solution, but I always recommend you try it yourself first.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,600
And then if you want the actual exercise document for every single one of these in resources, you'll

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,800
find a link, click it and it will take you to the exercise document that I created.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,650
So it has the instructions, the different files.

24
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,020
There might be some starter code that I give you, the different expectations step by step, what I'm

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,920
asking you to do.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,010
So one of these documents exists for every exercise in the course, and you'll find it attached to the

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,300
exercise video.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,340
So that's where you can find them.

29
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,770
Again, I hope that you get something out of them.

30
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,960
The only way you'll know is if you actually attempt them.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,260
So I really encourage you to do this in person when I teach.

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,870
Get the most learning without a doubt happens when students actually try using it and just get practice.

33
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,910
It's a weird thing to watch somebody use gadgets.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,390
You really need to do it yourself to get anything out of it.

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,700
Anyway, I hope you enjoy the exercises.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,750
That's how you find them.

37
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,470
Please do them.
