1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,030
Next up, I'd like to talk about who uses Git.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,360
So this will be pretty quick as well and optional.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,480
You don't have to know about this in order to use it.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,350
But the first most obvious group would be engineers, developers, coders ranging from people who work

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,210
on their own little tiny side projects or just hobby projects.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,560
Entrepreneurs up to massive tech giants like Facebook and Google Get is the most commonly used version

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,150
control system, as we talked about.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,580
And when you're developing applications, version control is very, very important to use.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,640
On its official home page, they list some of the companies that use it Google, Facebook, Microsoft,

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,500
Twitter, LinkedIn, Netflix.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,160
And then if you go to a website like Stack Share where you can view I don't know how accurate Stack

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,450
share is, but you can view different tools and companies that use them.

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,930
There's other companies like Robinhood, Reddit, Lyft, stack share itself uses get smaller companies,

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,630
Patreon, Fiverr, Canva.

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,010
I use Canva all the time.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,660
Massive companies like Walmart.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,680
Anyway, the point is it's used by pretty much any engineering team you can think of.

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,250
Also, another group that uses Git or at least would benefit from being familiar with Git are tech adjacent

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:17,820
roles.

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,760
So people who are not developers but work with developers or deal with developers learning the basics

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,450
of git.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,690
It's not all that difficult and it can help a lot with conversations, with deadlines, with just setting

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,680
expectations.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,950
And in particular, designers often need the basic understanding to be able to work with Git and communicate

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,970
with developers.

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,780
So another completely separate group of people who are using Get these days are governments and large

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,790
organizations, not technical.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:55,860
They're not I don't know tech startups governments use get a lot to manage the drafting of laws, collaboration

29
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,600
of drafting laws, sharing data and large data sets.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,750
So Washington DC City Council uses Git and GitHub.

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,199
We'll talk about GitHub in a bit to publish its laws and have made it a collaborative process and citizens

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,190
have actually found and fixed typos collaboratively in those laws.

33
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,690
They fix them using Git.

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,700
So I think I have some examples.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,930
Here we are.

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,940
This is the city of Chattanooga.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,280
They use GitHub, which again we'll talk about what GitHub is and how it compares to Git.

38
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,830
But all you need to know is that it's based on Git.

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,570
So this project is simple.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,230
It just shares parking locations in the city of Chattanooga.

41
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,400
And then if we go to GitHub Web page, they have something called Government GitHub.

42
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,180
They they show actually a whole bunch of different governments that use GitHub, which again is built

43
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,110
on top of Git.

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,920
So governments, groups from Argentina, Australia, the US, the UK, I mean pretty much every country

45
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,210
is listed here.

46
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,680
Now that doesn't mean that Git plays a central role in all of these governments.

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:07,890
For example, let's see USGS, the US Geological Survey, they have a whole bunch of things on GitHub

48
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,810
pages and pages of these projects that are shared with the public and they use Git to manage all of

49
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,160
them anyway.

50
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,430
So that's another group that use it these days.

51
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:25,560
Scientists also more and more are using Git to help collaborate on projects to share findings and data

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,890
sets to manage code and work together on code bases and get in GitHub together.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,590
Really work well in an open source or a peer reviewed world like science and research.

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,360
We'll learn more about GitHub.

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,010
I keep saying that, but we will.

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,120
And some other groups, writers, not all writers.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,520
Certainly it's not that common these days, but some writers really are becoming fans of Git.

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,290
I listened to some screenwriting podcasts to fall asleep to sometimes and every so often there's an

59
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,280
episode about using Git to write screenplays, manage versions, write.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,290
I talked about having different essay versions.

61
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,510
Well, with a screenplay you've got so many revisions, so many drafts or a novel, so many characters,

62
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,920
so many ways of structuring a novel, ordering things different arcs.

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,980
So Git is definitely gaining in popularity there.

64
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:20,459
And then specifically, I've seen multiple use cases of Git for collaborative textbook writing where

65
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,380
textbooks usually have multiple authors.

66
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,210
So this is a book, a textbook on informal homo topi.

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,260
I think it's homo topi type theory.

68
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,420
I have no clue what it is.

69
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,650
What the book I mean, this means nothing to me other than the fact that it's a textbook on something

70
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,580
crazy sounding.

71
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,390
But a lot of people have used this textbook.

72
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,990
It looks like a couple of thousand people have started.

73
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,350
So it's like a favorite of their projects on GitHub.

74
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,300
And here we'll see.

75
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,810
There's 85 people who have collaborated to write this textbook.

76
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,670
Just one simple example.

77
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,880
Now the last slide, anyone really can use it.

78
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,210
People find all sorts of creative uses from keeping a daily diary to writing their PhD thesis with Get

79
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,860
All the Way to composers.

80
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,730
I saw a Reddit comment from a music composer who writes symphonies and he uses Git to help track the

81
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,640
massive changes, all the different files, the parts as his symphonies evolve over time.

82
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,450
It's a month, multiple month process to write a symphony for a full orchestra with all the different

83
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,500
instruments written out.

84
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,510
He uses Git to help with that.

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,110
So I assume a lot of you who are watching this are probably in this group right there, or maybe this

86
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,650
group.

87
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,660
But increasingly I expect in the next few years there'll be more governments, more scientists, more

88
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,190
writers, more symphony composers who use Git.

89
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,720
Because it really can be, I won't say a life changer, maybe a life saver.

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,550
It can save you a lot of stress and time down the line, assuming you can get past the initial hurdle

91
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,420
of learning it.

92
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,900
We are on the precipice of learning it, so I'll shut up.
