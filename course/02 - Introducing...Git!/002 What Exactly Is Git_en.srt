1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,720
Okay.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,390
So let's begin with a very important question.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,340
What exactly is get?

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,380
So get is what's known as a version control system, sometimes abbreviated as VCs.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,820
Not only is it a VCs, it's actually the world's most popular version control system.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,120
So what exactly is a version control system?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,800
It doesn't sound all that glamorous.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,340
Essentially, version control is software that helps track and manage changes to a set of files over

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:29,940
time.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,920
Also, doesn't sound all that glamorous or exciting, but hugely important.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,730
Think of companies like Facebook or Google with huge code bases, thousands of files and thousands of

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,540
developers.

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,480
They're all working in parallel and making changes day to day.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,550
How do you manage those and track those changes and combine them and undo changes?

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,420
That is the role of a version control system like Git.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:02,100
In general, most version control systems allow things like revisiting earlier versions of files, comparing

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,129
changes made between different versions and different files.

18
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,800
Undoing changes, sharing changes with other people get does this and more.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,810
We're going to go into this in just a little bit, but that's a general intro to this concept of version

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,470
control.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,130
And to be clear, Git is just one of many version control options out there over the years.

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,630
They've kind of come and gone, but some of the more well-known ones include Subversion, CVS and Mercurial,

23
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,780
and they all have similar goals of helping developers or helping users track changes to projects over

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,320
time.

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,970
But they do have significant differences in how they operate, the syntax and how they achieve those

26
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,600
goals.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,640
But the good news for us, I mean, obviously this is a good course, so we're going to learn git but

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,580
there's a good reason to learn get it is the clear winner if there ever was a version control system

29
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,840
war get is clearly the most popular these days.

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,750
This is the most recent data I could find from three years ago 2018 StackOverflow Developer Survey.

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,060
Nearly 90% of respondents reported that Git was their version control system of choice.

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,370
And the thing is, in the last few years, this survey has just stopped asking this question.

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:21,990
It's abandoned it because it's just so clear the number is probably more like 95% these days of developers

34
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,920
that use Git.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,240
So we're here to learn Git.

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,620
That's good news for us.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,410
I'll end by just showing you what Git calls itself on the Get Home page.

38
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,300
It's a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,000
to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,470
It's easy to learn.

41
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,930
We'll see about that.

42
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,940
It's not bad to learn, but I wouldn't say it's painless and it has a tiny footprint with lightning

43
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,960
fast performance.

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,230
It outclasses other tools like subversion cves.

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,370
Oh boy, look at that.

46
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,960
Trash talking, the competition.

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,060
Anyway, the stuff we care about is up here.

48
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,600
It is a version control system that is git at its core.

49
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,410
It helps users manage changes to projects over time.

50
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,670
In the next video, we'll talk in more concrete terms about what Git actually does.
