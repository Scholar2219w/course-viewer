1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,830
So next up, I want to talk about an important distinction, the difference between GITS and GitHub.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,620
This course does cover both.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,580
They are closely related, but they are not the same thing.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,379
So get as we've been talking about is this version control software.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,830
It runs on somebody's machine, it runs on my laptop, it runs on your desktop or whatever.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,450
It runs on people's computers.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,310
It doesn't need Internet.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,620
You don't need to register for an account.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,750
It's just something that you download.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,910
If you don't have it yet and then you use it on your machine, you could never have internet ever.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,490
And you can still use Git in the same way that you could if you had like a text editor or Microsoft

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,130
Word or Excel, you can create those documents.

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,300
You don't need the Internet.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,160
You don't need to sign up.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,130
Although, I don't know, maybe these days Microsoft needs an account.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,700
I don't know.

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,390
But whatever text edit you can just write text documents whenever.

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,660
GitHub, on the other hand, is a service.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,950
It's a web service.

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,580
And what it does is it takes Git repositories.

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,930
That's the fancy way of saying get projects and it hosts them.

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,280
It stores them in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate on them with other people.

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,010
So it's a website you do need an account for.

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,150
You do need the Internet to use it and it takes the stuff you do locally on your laptop or my laptop

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,800
or whatever using Git.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,290
And then it allows us to put that online and share it with other people or the other way around.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,140
Other people can put their stuff online and then we can get their code or their get projects on our

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,890
machines.

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,310
So it connects people, it connects get projects.

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,280
And in this course we're going to start with Git first.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
You kind of have to we don't have a choice.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,690
We have to understand how Git works and the different commands before we can move on to GitHub.

33
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,300
So that will come second, although it's not like the course is split exactly in two because we do cover

34
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,450
some git content after we learn more about GitHub.

35
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,500
So just to try and visualize this or help you visualize it.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,110
If this is my project I've been working on locally on my machine, no internet, no collaborators involved

37
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,639
and this is my git history.

38
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,860
I have a whole series of these checkpoints.

39
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,100
If I wanted to share this with other people and collaborate with them, I could put it up on GitHub.

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,360
That's what I'm showing here.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,730
There's a cloud, that's the GitHub logo.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm taking this work and all this history and putting it online on GitHub for some collaborators or

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,040
maybe for the whole world to see.

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,440
Then those collaborators.

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,910
Here we've got two people.

46
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,460
They can take that work and get it on their machine.

47
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,160
They can add on, they can modify it, they can do their own work and then share that back up to GitHub

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,670
and then I can go and get it from GitHub and we can all work together.

49
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,700
So all of a sudden we can have lots and lots of people collaborating on projects thanks to GitHub.

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,500
That is something we will learn.

51
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,830
It's kind of a separate workflow, a set of skills that you need.

52
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,870
In addition to just understanding the basics of Git, we have multiple sections of GitHub ahead of us.

53
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,510
But first, as I've said, we're going to start with Git.

54
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,490
So that's all I wanted to say here.

55
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,870
I just wanted to make that clear.

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,450
Git and GitHub are not the same thing.

57
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,870
GitHub definitely requires some knowledge of Git.

58
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,260
It is a tool that is built for Git and forget users.

59
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,200
But you could live your entire life as a git developer.

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
Never touching GitHub.

61
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,860
Anyway, we'll talk more about it later on.

62
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,140
Let's focus on Git for now.
