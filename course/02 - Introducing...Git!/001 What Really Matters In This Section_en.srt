00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,450
Hey.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,350
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,420
At the beginning of every section, I'll have a video similar to this one where I talk about what actually

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,240
matters in this section, so I try to keep them brief.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,030
I just want to highlight of all the topics we cover what really is worth your time and stress to try

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,150
and get right versus what could you circle back to later?

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,930
So I'll use this Trello board I've made for all the topics in this course and I'll go through the main

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,000
topics in this section, which is just an introduction to get nothing very well, nothing technical

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,750
really at all.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,420
We're just going to cover some important conceptual topics.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,890
So all these topics are labeled as green, meaning that they're pretty easy to pick up.

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,540
Some of the other topics later on are a bit more challenging, but we're going to talk about what is

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,020
get.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,060
I would say that is probably critical understanding the difference between Git and GitHub, critical

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,830
understanding the history of Git, not critical to using and working with Git.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,090
There's a video about who uses Git different use cases.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,740
It's not just engineers these days.

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,510
Governments, scientists, writers.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,300
So I'll say important on the verge with nice to have I wouldn't really spend a lot of time on it.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,720
What does get do for us that is also going to be critical.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,440
We need to understand the purpose of Git before we actually learn the commands.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,080
So that's pretty much it for this section and what matters.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,260
The main takeaways focus on what is Git, what is it compared to GitHub and what exactly does get do

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,980
for us?

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,390
Okay, let's go.
