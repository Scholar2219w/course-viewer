1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,600
I can also get dif to compare changes between two branches.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,120
So if I have two branches currently I don't in the repo I was showing you, but whatever branch one

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,460
is and branch two are get will do a diff between the files in those branches.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,570
So all the files in those branches, although you can narrow it down as well.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,040
So let's do a quick demo of that.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,860
I need to make a branch, so why don't I commit the changes?

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,900
I added what indigo and I added Violet and I added my numbers file.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:38,550
Let's just go with add violet and create numbers and then I'll add a couple of numbers here.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,320
One, two, three, four, get status.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,870
Let's do clear this, get commit a am.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,020
Add more numbers.

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,220
All righty.

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,360
And now if I make a branch.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,870
So I'm going to create a new branch.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,150
Get switch, dash.

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,810
See?

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,200
We'll call this branch about odd numbers.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,580
So on this branch, I'm only going to have odd numbers.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,840
So I'm going to delete two and I'll delete four.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:23,220
I'll do a commit, so I'll add numbers, then I'll commit removed two and four, and then let's also

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,810
add five down at the bottom.

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:33,610
So we'll do a git, add numbers, get commit, add five OC.

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,700
So right now we have two branches.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,230
Nothing very exciting, but we have master and odd numbers.

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,940
And if I want to do a comparison between the two of them, I want to see what has changed from master

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,850
to odd numbers or vice versa.

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,720
The order does matter, but I list the two branches and I separate them by two dots.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,060
Or you can actually just add a space.

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,460
Both of them will do the same thing.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,530
So let's do.

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,770
Let's do from master to odd numbers first.

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,590
So get diff master dot dot odd numbers.

33
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,640
And the only file that changed was numbers.

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,320
We still have the colors file on both branches, but there's no differences, so there's nothing to

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,040
display.

36
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,920
Now here we can see that numbers dot text version A, which is from the master branch.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,220
Because of that order that I wrote, Master, two odd numbers.

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,960
This one is from the master branch and this one is from my odd numbers branch.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,370
So we see that on the master branch, which is a it has the minus sign in front of it.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,350
That's its designated symbol.

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,020
We had one, two, three, four and we did not have this stuff right.

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,030
Then on B, we have the plus sign as its symbol.

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,300
So we had one, three and then five.

44
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,790
So that's new on the odd numbers branch and it does not include two and four.

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,870
If I change the order, get diff odd numbers and then master.

46
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,940
Now we see things have flipped.

47
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:13,710
So A has been assigned the minus sign but a this time is the odd numbers branch and B is master.

48
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,050
So here right on the master branch.

49
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,990
B with the plus sign we have one, two, three, four, and it's the opposite of what we saw previously.

50
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,760
So that order does matter.

51
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,240
Also, just to make this clear, we get the same outcome if we just use a space, but people like to

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,920
use the dot dot, maybe it makes it I don't know, it makes it clearer, you know, that you're doing

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,170
that comparison, but you'll see both of them.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,980
And then let me just quickly change one of these files.

55
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,720
So let's do red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violets.

56
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,300
I don't know.

57
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,080
Odd numbers will only display the odd numbered color.

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,200
So if this is one, get rid of two, that's three.

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,750
We get rid of four, five and six.

60
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:55,650
I don't know.

61
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,720
I might have totally screwed that up, but whatever.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,190
We have fewer colors here.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,170
So now we type get status.

64
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,640
Let's make a commit here.

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,920
So I'll add the colors file and we'll just go with remove some colors.

66
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,030
All right.

67
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,870
So now if I do a get diff, let's go from master to odd numbers again.

68
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,370
We have two files that are showing up.

69
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,779
So the colors file changed from master to odd numbers.

70
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,800
Right on master, which is a we had orange, green and indigo.

71
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,880
They are not present on the odd numbers branch and we didn't add anything new.

72
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,940
But on the numbers file we have the same thing we saw earlier.

73
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,500
We don't need to go over it again.

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,720
So now we have multiple files because there were changes to multiple files between those branches.

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,660
So that's how you compare branches with git diff, dot dot or a space between two branch names.
