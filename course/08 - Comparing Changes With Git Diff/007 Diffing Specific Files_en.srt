1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,140
Another thing we can do is narrow down the diff to a specific file or files.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,970
So instead of just everything right, all on stage changes or are all stage changes or all changes since

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,430
head whatever we're actually looking at, we can narrow it down and say only in this one file.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,990
So currently we don't have a lot going on here that we would want to narrow down.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,370
But if I do get def, get def, get diff staged as we saw in the last video, I'm getting two files.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:37,230
I'm looking at all changes that are currently staged, but I could say actually only show me the numbers

7
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,310
file how that has changed and that's exactly what we see.

8
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,010
So as an example, let's say I have this really large project I've been working on.

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,430
I showed a couple of videos ago where there's a lot of CSS and I made a lot of changes in this main

10
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,920
CSS, and I want to see what those changes are since the last commit so I can do get diff head.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,550
But there are other files I changed to right index html main css.

12
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,570
But also there's another file I changed JavaScript file here.

13
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,420
You can see that and this is still not a whole lot of changes.

14
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,980
Let's say it's been a couple of hours.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,190
I just want to see the changes since my last commit to my CSS file main CSS.

16
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,730
So this is the path style slash main CSS.

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,600
I can narrow it down, get diff and then style slash main CSS.

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,020
And specifically what I want is get diff head because I want to see all changes staged over on Unstaged

19
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,490
since the last commit in that one file and that's what we see.

20
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:49,320
So these changes are specifically from this file and we can see right since the last commit I added

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,550
these lines, I added this line and I added this line.

22
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,650
Really it's I modified, right?

23
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,530
I edited a line, but it doesn't show it that way.

24
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,130
It says this came from file A, it's gone in file B and this came from file B.

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
It's not in file A.

26
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,680
All right.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,289
So that's how we can narrow it down to a particular file.

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,960
I can also do multiple, for example.

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,630
There's also an index, that HTML file.

30
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,350
I just separate them by spaces and now I have two files.

31
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm looking at the diff for the main css and for index html.

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,800
So this also works.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,340
If I want to see the stage changes, I don't think I have any.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,570
Nope.

35
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,710
They're all unstaged.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,110
But if I wanted to, I could do dash dash stage or dash dash cache and other variations.

37
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,900
I can narrow it down to a particular file or files.
