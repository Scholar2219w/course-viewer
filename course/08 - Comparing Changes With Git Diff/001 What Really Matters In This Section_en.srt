1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,690
Okay.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,410
So I hope you made it through merging.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,780
Now we move on to a section all about one command called git diff.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,670
And honestly, most of this section is going to go under important, not critical.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,920
These commands that I'm going to show you are useful or the command I'm going to show you is useful.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,630
But it's not something that's going to come up.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,700
Every single time you use Git, it's like every moment you turn to get throughout the day.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,010
On the job, for example, it might come up once in a day or maybe a couple of times in a day, or maybe

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,940
never in a day.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,410
So unlike things like adding and committing and get status and all of that stuff, which is like the

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,030
bread and butter, you can't get around it.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,200
Same with branching.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,110
The git diff command is just not as important.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,240
With that said, it is very useful.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,280
So the whole section is all about get diff.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,410
This command that works in different ways.

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,680
It helps us make comparisons between different commits, different branches, between different files,

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,800
between the staging area and the working directory and all these different areas and different things

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,480
that we can compare in a repo.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,110
So it's one command and the most important thing at the beginning is understanding how to read the outputs

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,730
of the git diff command, which is probably the most complicated part of the section.

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,920
So it's in yellow, but it's not too bad.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,290
I worked pretty hard on the slides, I think it turned out well.

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,770
If I do say so myself then understanding the basics of using git diff I'll say is critical.

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:30,060
Everything else important, important, important, important but not critical.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,760
So hopefully that gives you a good picture of the section.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,290
Focus on the basics of git diff, what it does, how to read the output.

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,550
That part is critical.

29
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,770
And then there's like, I don't know what, five or six additional videos where I show different ways

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,000
of using the command.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,460
They're important, but I wouldn't lose sleep over them.

32
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,320
You don't need to study them or anything.

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,600
Okay, so let's get started with git diff.
