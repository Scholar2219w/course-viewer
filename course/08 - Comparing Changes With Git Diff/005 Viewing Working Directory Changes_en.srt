1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,610
The next version we'll look at is git diff head.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,100
So this will list all changes in our working directory since the last commit since head.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,430
Right.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,920
Remember head is this pointer, this reference to the last commit and typically the last commit on a

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,490
branch.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,150
So wherever head is when we do get diff head, we'll see the changes that we've made since head.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:31,350
So that includes if we try this again here get diff head that includes staged and unstaged changes.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:38,490
So right now we see the same exact output that we saw when I just did regular get diff.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,550
This is showing all unstaged changes.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,560
This is showing everything that has changed since our last commit since head.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:54,900
However, if I stage something, if I do get add and then our file is called what colors text if I do

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,930
get diff again now we don't see any changes.

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,180
Right.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,610
Nothing is showing up because this is supposed to show me the difference between my working directory

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,720
and the staging area.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,310
And right now they're the same.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,120
But if I do get diff head this is showing me the difference between the head and my working directory.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,550
So now we see the same thing we were seeing earlier.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,500
So now let's go ahead and commit.

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,050
So get commit m just add indigo and then I'm going to do something different.

21
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,900
Now I'm going to make what should I do?

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,580
I guess I'll make a new file and this new file will be called it doesn't really matter, but it will

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,510
be numbers.

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,870
All right.

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:40,020
So touch numbers dot txt and in this numbers file, I'm just going to add the number one to begin with.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,880
So I'll just spell it out in all caps one OC.

27
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,410
So currently numbers is untracked.

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,800
So if I try and do get diff, I'm not going to see anything there.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,370
However if I add that new change, so get add numbers dot txt.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,570
Now if I do get diff head, we see that since our last commits we have some new stuff.

31
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,080
Right.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,470
And it's just the fact that numbers text now exists and it has this line one inside of it.

33
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,940
The way that we can tell that there was nothing there before the version A is actually dev slash null.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,240
That's gets a way of telling us nothing compared to now having the file numbers.

35
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,620
So there was nothing really to compare it before, but that doesn't break it.

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,850
We just end up seeing only the additions because they're only our additions.

37
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,520
So get diff head shows us that.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,620
But just one more time get diff on its own.

39
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,960
It's only showing us unstaged changes.

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,260
Nothing has been or nothing is currently unstaged.

41
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:51,270
But if I add violet for example to colors and I do get diff, we only see a diff for colors because

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,300
that's the only file that changed that has not been staged versus get diff head.

43
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:06,240
If I just remind you here numbers is staged colors is not so if I do get diff head I see all changes

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,380
staged on stage.

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:14,280
It doesn't matter anything new in the working directory since head right and head if you ever forget

46
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,900
and head currently is pointing to this commit here so that's what we are comparing to so get diff shows

47
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,680
us all unstaged changes get diff head shows us all changes staged and unstaged since head.
