1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,480
All right.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,630
So now we're going to walk through some of the different ways of using get diff.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:11,340
We've got get diff, get diff head get diff staged and cached and then we have git diff head with a

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,040
file name, get diff staged for the file name, branch names that we can use, we can put commit hashes

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,750
in there.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,640
So there's a lot that we can cover.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,430
It all follows a very similar pattern though, so it's not super difficult.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,260
But I'm going to begin by making a very basic repo that we can follow along with instead of this crazy

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,310
one, right?

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,050
With all these changes in tons of files, I'm going to do just a trivial example.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,560
It all works the same way, so I'm not in a repo at the moment.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,530
I'll admit a repo and I'm going to make just like colors file, colors, text.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,320
And why wouldn't I add a commit right now?

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,740
Get add colors, text, get commit.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,660
We'll just do initial commit.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,760
I'm just going to make some basic history and then here's my file.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,660
So I'll add red into that file and then I'll do a commit a m, which just means add everything and then

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,680
m for message.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,240
So I don't have to add in commit.

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,180
I'm going to just do this very quickly.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,530
I'll probably fast forward.

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,630
So this one will be add orange.

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,090
I'm just going to build up the rainbow one commit at a time.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,250
Maybe I'll do yellow and green together.

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,220
So this let me clear.

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,950
We'll be add yellow and green and then blue and purple.

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,410
So I'll do the same thing.

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,250
Add a commit message, add blue and purple.

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,370
So we've got our rainbow set up now.

30
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,290
And I have a tiny bit of history.

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,140
I have, what, five commits so far?

32
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,160
That's enough for us to start using get diff.

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,700
So the first version I showed you, the only version is just get diff with nothing else.

34
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,090
And this will show us all the changes in our working directory that are not staged for the next commit.

35
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,620
So it compares staging and the working directory.

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,230
Also staging is usually refer to the index on the documentation.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,410
It's just confusing.

38
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,760
Staging makes more sense.

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,850
So a lot of people say that right now, if I run it, there's no difference because there are no changes

40
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,300
at all.

41
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,770
There's nothing in the staging area, there's nothing in the working directory, nothing has changed.

42
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:25,720
So if I instead do something simple like, well, what I did in the last video, if I remove purple.

43
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,320
Right, and replace it as indigo.

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,270
Let's just save that.

45
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,720
If I type get status, we see.

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,080
All right.

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,690
There's something that's been modified and now if I type get diff, we see an actual diff.

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,600
So this is showing us a comparison between what the index knows about and what the staging area has

49
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,090
versus the changes that we've made.

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,790
Another way of thinking about it is that the differences are what we could tell get to add to the staging

51
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,280
area.

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,350
So as we see here in our color file, right, we're comparing one file to the next.

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,570
First version is A, second version is B, so A is what the staging area knows about.

54
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,680
Versus B is the changes we have in our working directory.

55
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,200
So A gets the minus sign, right?

56
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,430
B gets the plus sign.

57
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:23,810
So in the version of our files that the staging area last knew about, Purple was still there.

58
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,380
Right.

59
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,810
That's what that minus sign means versus with the version of the file that is actually in our working

60
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,500
directory.

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,360
We see that Indigo has been added, so that's what the plus indicates.

62
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,950
It doesn't always mean something is new.

63
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,400
It just means that it came from file B and in our case, file B are the new changes.

64
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,180
So that's all I'll show you in this video.

65
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,010
Just to make this point one more time.

66
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,240
Get diff on its own.

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,080
We'll list the changes in our working directory that are not staged.
