1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,120
So the last thing I'll show you here is how to use get cracking or a similar gooey tool to visualize

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,560
diffs to actually see them in a file instead of having to see them in your terminal.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,720
A lot of the time this is really useful, especially if you're working on large projects with tons of

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,230
files.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,640
And this is one of the areas I think always shine when you're working with Git.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,950
So here's get cracking.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,530
Unfortunately, as I've said a couple of times before, I can't make this any larger, so it lets me

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,189
make it larger up until this point, which is still not very large.

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,210
So I'll do my best to try and enhance and zoom in in post-production.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,390
But here's my colors repository.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,490
Very simple, right?

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,750
We have our initial commit, we added red, orange, yellow, green, add blue and purple had indigo.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,480
Then I created this odd numbers branch.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,840
Right.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,000
I removed two and four from the numbers.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,320
It's this project file here, numbers and colors.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,620
If I visually if I want to see a diff, let's start by making some unstaged changes right now.

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,070
Right.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,930
Get status.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,099
Nothing to commit working tree clean.

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,960
So why don't I add something to colors like I love the rainbow.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,790
We'll save that.

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,540
And then in numbers, let's add five.

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,700
This is on the master branch.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,900
Six and seven like that.

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,780
All right, so now I have two files that have been changed, both of which are unstaged.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,920
So now, as it shows me here to file changes in working directory, I can click to view those changes.

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,750
So that's what it's showing me here.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,790
Unstaged and staged.

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,650
So I can click on either these files and it visually shows me this new change showing it to me in the

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,550
file here.

32
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,170
I love the Rainbow was added it shows it in green so you can see there.

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,090
Also, here's our little diff header.

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,460
It's not showing the entire file right.

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,330
I can see I can click to see file view or just diff view.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,850
And then same thing with numbers here.

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,400
It's showing me that five, six and seven are new.

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,420
They've been added.

39
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,060
Let's do something slightly different.

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,880
Let's delete for whatever reason.

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,990
I don't know.

42
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,700
We'll get rid of Violet.

43
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,930
Okay.

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,340
So now go back to colors and it's showing me violet that has been removed it's non existent currently

45
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:32,200
versus I love the rainbow has been added and again it's just showing me the diff view and then if I

46
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,220
wanted to, if I stage one of these files, let's stage colors.

47
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,800
I can go here and see.

48
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,930
Okay, here's the changes I have staged.

49
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,490
Here's the changes I've unstaged.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,840
So if I stage both files and I just want to see that diff now, I can just go between them.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,340
Nothing has changed in terms of what is what's different and what's not different.

52
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,670
It's just if I was doing this with Git commands, I would do get diff versus get diff head versus git

53
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,070
get diff staged here.

54
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,600
It's just a matter of clicking.

55
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,610
If they're in the stage two files area, then I'm viewing a diff for what is staged.

56
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:15,620
If they are not staged here, I'm looking at the unstaged changes from numbers, dot text, other things

57
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,730
that we can do.

58
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,160
If I get out of here quickly.

59
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,870
Sometimes I you get lost.

60
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,380
Here it is.

61
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,400
Can X out.

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,990
If I want to see changes between two commits, for example, I can click on one commit like where we

63
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:36,440
added indigo and then hold down shift and select another commit like that.

64
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,370
And then over here it's showing me viewing diff between two commits.

65
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,120
There's only one file that changed and this is what changed, right?

66
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,590
This is the difference between them.

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:53,390
So I removed purple, I added indigo between those two commits or let's do a more drastic difference

68
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,920
from the very beginning.

69
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,550
Or How about when we added red up to when we added indigo?

70
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,470
Here's what changed.

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,580
Or I could have multiple files involved.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,150
I'll open a different project.

73
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,960
Here's a much larger project.

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,960
That 2048 app I was showing you right where we had the more complicated diffs.

75
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,899
If I wanted to visually see the difference between some commits, I could.

76
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,290
I don't know.

77
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,260
Let's just pick two early commits.

78
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
How about.

79
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,990
Sure.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
Those two.

81
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,930
I can see all of these files were changed.

82
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,710
Although it looks like ten of them were renamed, but four files were modified.

83
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,100
And then I can see the different chunks.

84
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,670
I can see the chunk headers.

85
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,460
So this is visually for me, a lot easier.

86
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,830
It's often a lot easier to work with if I really am trying to understand the difference between two

87
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,320
commits or between two two branches or something like that.

88
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,870
Doing it from the command line.

89
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,390
Good to know how to do and I still use that.

90
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:59,840
But if I really need to dig down into the changes and spend some time working through what's different,

91
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,710
then I really like the diff view from editors or from guys like get cracking.

92
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:10,190
So if I want to see the same thing that I'm seeing over here and I just type get diff head, this is

93
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,910
everything that's changed since the last commits very early in the section.

94
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:21,650
I think the first or second video I changed index HTML, I changed grid JS and I changed main CSS so

95
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,860
I can view that here I click on my work in progress.

96
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,490
So this is nothing committed yet.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,470
And then I can see the three files one at a time.

98
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,210
Here's what's changed in index.

99
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,460
I can visualize it pretty easy.

100
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,850
I can stage, I can see what changed in the grid JS file and in main course.

101
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,230
So I find this just better, easier to work with than this personally.

102
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,190
And the last thing I'll show you is if you want more context, you want the entire file.

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,870
Right now we're in hunk.

104
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,580
People call it hunk instead of chunk.

105
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,710
Sometimes they mean the same thing.

106
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:01,670
I'm viewing one chunk or one hunk at a time versus in line view shows me the entire file with the diff

107
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,610
right there so I can find that one down there.

108
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,100
It's not too bad, but some of the files are longer.

109
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,460
Right.

110
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:14,360
So I've got a scroll quite a ways if I want to see everything versus if I go to Hunk View, I just see

111
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,570
the three hunks with some context around each change.

112
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,890
So that's it.

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,410
Nice part of get cracking and all these other guys, they pretty much all offer a view like this.

114
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,520
It's pretty standard.
