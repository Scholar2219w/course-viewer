1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,170
Another variation of git diff is to pass in this option dash dash staged or alternatively cached.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,440
They do the same thing, just an alias.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,380
Both of them will show us the staged changes, only the changes that are staged.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,840
So we've seen how to do all unstaged, we've seen how to do staged and on staged this.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,520
Both of these options are how you do only stage changes, only show me the staged changes.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,960
What is the difference between my last commit and the staging area?

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,369
So I'll show this to you.

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,390
Now, if we take a look at git status, the same project.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,990
Project is a stretch but the same repository changes to be committed numbers text.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,020
We added one into numbers, then we have some changes for the colors file we added violet, but that

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,270
is not part of the staging area.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:01:00,570
So right now if I do a if I can type it, get diff dash, dash and then staged, we only see those changes

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,930
from numbers because that's the change versus if I do get diff on its own.

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,640
This is unstaged changes.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,230
So we see colours and if I do get diff head, we see both.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,920
Right.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,390
That's everything that has changed.

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,100
It doesn't care if it's staged or not.

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:25,050
And then if I add in colours, so if I do get add colours now if I do get diff dash dash stage, we

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,620
see both because both of those changes have been staged at this point.

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,310
Also we can use cached for whatever reason.

22
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,230
I don't like cache to think just I call the staging area stage makes more sense to me.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,810
But I do believe the docs actually reference cache first and then say stage is an alias of cached.

24
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,680
It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,460
All right.

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,780
So quick quiz here.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,680
What will we see?

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,910
Here's my git status.

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,800
Well, let's see if I do get diff.

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,860
Think about it.

31
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,230
The answer is nothing.

32
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,470
Well, I guess we see end, but there's no changes to display because get diff is showing us unstaged

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:00,890
changes.

34
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,600
There are no unstaged changes.

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,820
Everything has been staged at this point.
