1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,070
Next up, let's talk about deleting files and folders.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,970
This is the last important thing.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,660
Well, there are other important commands, but this is the last of the fundamentals of working with

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,070
files and navigating.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,260
So to delete a file, we have a command arm.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:22,530
I assume it stands for remove and all we need to do is RAM and then a space and then reference a file

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,070
name.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,350
Assuming that the file is in our current directory or we need to reference the correct path to get to

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,040
that file.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,350
Now the thing you need to know up front is that this is not going to put it in your trashcan or your

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,090
recycling bin or whatever it's called.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,710
This deletes the file.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,730
It is gone.

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,120
So you want to be careful with this, right?

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,650
You don't want to go around deleting crucial files, although this is a good course and get can help

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,920
solve or alleviate these issues if you delete something accidentally.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,520
If it was being tracked by Git, we can restore it with a single command.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,930
It's very easy and painless.

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,150
Anyway, that's getting ahead of ourselves.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,830
Let me demonstrate how this works.

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,220
Just remember this permanently deletes the file.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,800
So what should we delete?

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,360
If you want to follow along, you might want to just make something to delete first so you could do

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,860
touch delete me.

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,310
So I didn't even give it a file extension.

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,650
If we look at it, where am I?

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,300
I'm in the turtles directory.

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,760
I could always do P to verify.

29
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,780
So that's right.

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,470
Here.

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,000
Here's the file I made.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,440
I could even rename it from here.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,280
How about we make it a dot d dock exe file which is Microsoft Word?

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,590
And it's going to ask me, are you sure you want to do that?

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,150
It doesn't matter.

36
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,050
I'm going to delete it.

37
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,130
But I wanted to show you, if you make modifications here, I could even rename this.

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,450
Delete me with a bunch of M or with a bunch of eas at the end if I type ls.

39
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,500
Now this is up to date as well, so to delete it it's just arm and then the name of the file.

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,030
And that's because I'm in this folder, so I don't need to reference some other path.

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,830
This is exactly what I need.

42
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,230
If I hit enter, you can see it disappears.

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,050
Whoops, that's not ls I meant to type?

44
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,780
LS It's gone so it's not coming back.

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,310
We're not using git right now.

46
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,900
So that is gone.

47
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,880
That that file is totally gone.

48
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,450
So let's make two more files to delete just really quickly.

49
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,880
How about delete dot txt and remove dot xls?

50
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,500
That's I think that's excel.

51
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,550
Maybe not.

52
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,040
Well, whatever that extension is, I thought it was Excel.

53
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,850
It doesn't matter.

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,790
I'm going to delete them, so I'll do them together.

55
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,930
They're both here.

56
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,590
You can see them.

57
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,600
There are them.

58
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,900
Delete text space removed xls.

59
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,600
They're both gone.

60
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,660
Quickly, I'll show it over here.

61
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,740
Let's delete this cyan file that I made on my windows side.

62
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,020
So here it is.

63
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:57,910
Cyan JS RMB Cyan JS if I type ls it does not show up here.

64
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,080
And if I look over here and the file explorer, it's not here.

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,710
I don't.

66
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,630
Maybe there's a way to make this larger.

67
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,350
There we go.

68
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,030
Well, still, it's not here.

69
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,470
Okay, so the next thing I want to talk about is deleting folders.

70
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,930
If I want to delete this folder, land turtles right there.

71
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,350
I cannot use the M command as it stands.

72
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,320
Land turtles like that it says nope.

73
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,350
Land turtles is a directory rmm delete files or at least our RAM the way we used it.

74
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:38,530
So we actually have a variation of RAM in order to delete a folder or a directory or RAM dash.

75
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,950
RF We haven't talked about flags.

76
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,620
This is just a crash course in the basic terminal navigation, the essential commands you need to know.

77
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,050
But all of the commands we've used actually accept a bunch of options that modify how they behave.

78
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,750
So as a quick example, LS actually has a couple of other variations.

79
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:05,860
One is LS Dash A which is going to show me hidden files so that Dash A modifies the behavior of LRS.

80
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,490
It says list all files including hidden hidden files.

81
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,440
Start with a dot so there's a hidden file.

82
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,190
This will actually come up when we make a git repository.

83
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,550
It makes a hidden directory for us anyway, getting ahead of myself.

84
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:25,540
So these flags are different options we can pass in and there are two we will use on prem if we want

85
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,520
to delete a directory r and F, we don't need to go too much into what they mean.

86
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,840
They stand for recursive.

87
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,150
That's the R and force is the F.

88
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,250
Basically this is how we delete a folder.

89
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,890
But you want to be careful with this because just like with deleting a file from the command line or

90
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,720
from the terminal, it's gone.

91
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,250
So if you delete a directory that's full of important stuff and it's not backed up somewhere, it's

92
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,860
not in the cloud, it's gone.

93
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,600
That's kind of end of story.

94
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,860
So let's say I want to delete the entire turtles directory.

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,980
Why don't I start by deleting land turtles?

96
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,210
I didn't mean to type this, by the way, so I want to delete land turtles again.

97
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,180
REM land turtles does not work, but rem dash r f land turtles will.

98
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,770
It's gone.

99
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,390
There's no land turtles here.

100
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,090
But that was an empty directory.

101
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:23,860
If I try and delete turtles, which itself has it doesn't have a lot but turtles has sea turtles folder

102
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,990
and george p a file.

103
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,330
I'm now in the directory above it.

104
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,210
I'm in pets so I'm going to try deleting it.

105
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,560
So I'll clear, by the way on a mac that shortcut, if I have a bunch of stuff to clear is command k.

106
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:45,370
Anyway, I'm in the pets directory and if I want to delete turtles ram dash, R.F. Turtles.

107
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,860
So you'll see it over here.

108
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,910
There it is.

109
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,270
And there it goes.

110
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,040
It's gone.

111
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,880
And that's it.

112
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,780
I can't navigate into turtles.

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,880
It doesn't exist.

114
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,010
No such file or directory.

115
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,060
But remember, I need the dash ref to do that if it's a folder.

116
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,830
If it's just a file, I just do.

117
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,110
And either way, those are gone.

118
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,380
They're gone for good.

119
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,500
So be careful.

120
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,240
You know, don't go around running this command on very important files and folders.

121
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,770
Just always take a moment to think about what you're doing because you don't have that intermediate

122
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,070
step of dragging something to the trash.

123
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,070
But not much of this course really relies on deleting stuff.

124
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,840
To be honest, it's mostly creating things and tracking those things with get and changing those files.

125
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,320
So it's not like we're going around deleting a bunch of stuff.

126
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,870
I just figured you should know about those commands because they will come up every so often.

127
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
All right, so that's our M and our M dash RF.

128
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,070
They're both the same command.

129
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,560
Just a variation to delete folders.
