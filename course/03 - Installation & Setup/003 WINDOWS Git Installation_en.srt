1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,470
Okay.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,560
So this is the windows get installation video.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,490
If you're not on a Windows machine, I guess you're welcome to join us if you want, but I would just

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:15,600
move on and go to the next video installing get on a Windows machine is it's not complicated, but it's

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,150
a little bit trickier than to do it on a mac.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,300
And the reason for this is that git was designed it was created.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,690
If you watch that video where I did The Brief History of Git, it was created to run on a Unix based

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,200
interface.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,320
It was designed for Linux because the guy who created it, Linus Torvalds, also created Linux.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:41,910
OC The problem that we run into on a Windows machine is that Windows machines don't come with a Unix

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,860
based prompt by default.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,090
Windows comes with a different command line interface called command prompt.

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,650
It's not Unix based.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,230
If you don't know what Unix is, it really it's not a big deal.

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,520
You don't need to know what it is.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,500
It just causes an issue here.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,320
Get wants to run with a Unix based interface and there's this shell, this thing called Bash that it's

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,690
a default shell for Linux machines and for Macs.

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,340
So it's a lot easier on those machines.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,460
We don't have to jump through any hoops on a Windows machine.

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,750
We have to download something called Get Bash, which we're about to do.

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,140
And get Bash is going to emulate a bash, a Unix experience on our Windows Machine and it comes with

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,100
Git also.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,060
So some people actually use Git bash without even touching the git portion.

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,730
They just want the bash portion anyway.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,800
You'll see it's not too bad.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,060
It's a single package we download and then it's just a couple of menus and settings that we have to

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,810
walk through.

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,640
So that's all we're going to do here.

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,680
If none of that explanation made sense to you, don't worry, we'll just install it and it should work.

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,260
But if you're curious, this is kind of the issue at the core of why it's a little trickier on Windows.

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,510
Git was not designed to run on a Windows machine originally, so there's just an extra hurdle or two.

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,680
OC Let's go.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,430
All right.

35
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,290
So the first thing we need to do is go to the Git Home page, the Git website, and download the Git

36
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,610
installer for Windows.

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,130
So I've included in the resources a link.

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,490
It's also just git sxm.

39
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,940
I never remember that and I just google or or bing git and then click the link.

40
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,910
So I'm going to click download just the version that it suggesting for me on my Windows machine you

41
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,070
can see the other options 62 and 64 bits, but anyway, it looks like it finished.

42
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,900
So I'm going to open this up.

43
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,560
All righty.

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,970
I'm going to click.

45
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,240
Yes.

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,220
Do I want to allow it to make changes?

47
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,640
And is there a way to make this larger?

48
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,530
Does not look like it.

49
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,060
So I'll try zooming in in post-production to make this a little bit easier for you to see.

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,790
It's quite small on this large screen.

51
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,860
Anyway, I'm going to click next.

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,120
This is the license.

53
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,820
You know, I've read the entire thing.

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,230
All right, I'll hit next, then it's asking where I want to install it.

55
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,310
I'll leave the default.

56
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,060
So C drive program files get next up here.

57
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,110
I'm just going to leave all these defaults so I'm not going to check or uncheck anything and click next.

58
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,740
And then it's saying the name of the shortcut that it creates for me.

59
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,850
I'll just call it quits, and that's good to go.

60
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,430
Now, this is one spot where I recommend actually deviating from the default.

61
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,980
So it's asking us to choose the default text editor that get uses.

62
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,890
Now, the default that it uses right now is something called vim.

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,950
It is kind of a nightmare if you've never used it.

64
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,000
The commands and it's all done via text in the terminal.

65
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,610
A lot of people use it, but way, way more people are scared of it and confused by it.

66
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,140
So I recommend switching this over to VTS code or Visual Studio code.

67
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,760
So this is a brand new install of windows on my computer.

68
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,550
I don't actually have VTS code yet, so I'm going to click this use Visual Studio code, Visual Studio

69
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,830
code as its default editor and it doesn't let me hit next because I don't have it installed.

70
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:06,620
So I'm going to click that link and just open it up and then download for Windows.

71
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,210
We won't need this text editor right away and you don't have to use this editor either.

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,930
I have a video where I explain how to get out of Vim and how to use Vim in one context.

73
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,360
So if you want to use Vim, you can do that.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,020
Or if you have some other editor that you like, feel free to use that instead.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,180
So this is a pretty quick install.

76
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,800
Just accept the agreement.

77
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,330
Location is fine.

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,190
That's good to go.

79
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,910
And then I'm going to leave this check to add to PATH.

80
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:42,740
We want that and I'm going to click this register code as an editor for supported file types so that

81
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,480
the bottom two checkbox is there and then I'll click next install.

82
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,590
And hopefully that goes pretty quickly.

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,020
And then while that finishes up, I guess I do actually have to wait for it to finish in order to go

84
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,890
back to the other installer for get so that finished.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,370
We could launch it right now, but we really don't need it.

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:10,120
All that we need that for is so that we can use VTS code as the default editor so it doesn't register

87
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,770
that we actually have that.

88
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,820
I'm going to click back and next again, okay, now it's working.

89
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,050
So we still have Visual Studio code selected and now I can click next.

90
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,840
And then here, this is a bigger topic actually that we're not going to go into a whole lot right now,

91
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,080
but a bigger topic we discussed throughout the course in late 2020, there's been a push without going

92
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,740
into too much detail, there's been a push to rename the default branch in Git and GitHub from master

93
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,720
to Main or some other similar name like Trunk or development.

94
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,640
We'll talk more about what this means.

95
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,540
We haven't talked about branches at all, so that probably makes no sense.

96
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:56,770
I'm actually going to say let git decide and keep it as the current default branch name, but later

97
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,200
on I will show you how to change the default branch name.

98
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,090
We'll talk about how to work with Main instead of master and we'll cover all of this.

99
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,360
So to keep things simple and to keep you sort of in sync with the standard documentation and tutorials

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,640
you'll see in the world right now, we're going to just let Git decide, all right.

101
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,130
And then I'll leave this alone as well.

102
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,760
Okay.

103
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,140
I'm going to click next again.

104
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,980
Leave this as use the OpenSSL library.

105
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,690
So on this page or this screen, we're going to leave the top option selected.

106
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,590
Check out window style commit Unix style line endings.

107
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,280
It doesn't matter what that does right now, but we're going to pick that first one.

108
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,430
And then we have this screen.

109
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,820
Which terminal emulator do we want to use?

110
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,270
If you want to follow along with me and what I'll be using well through the throughout the course,

111
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,670
I'm using a mac, but on the Windows specific videos, I'll be using this first one min dt why?

112
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,730
And then we're going to select default, just the default option that's already selected for us.

113
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,090
And then, yep, we'll just keep this one selected.

114
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,890
Get credentialed manager core.

115
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,350
Well, enable file system caching that's already selected.

116
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,610
We're good to go.

117
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,820
And we don't need to enable support for pseudo councils, so we don't need to select that.

118
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,080
And then we click install.

119
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,980
And we wait for this to finish.

120
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,510
And I'll probably fast forward.

121
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,090
All right.

122
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,680
So it looks like it finished up.

123
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,910
Let's launch it.

124
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,080
So we'll click launch, get bash and then we can get rid of this.

125
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,720
We don't I don't care to see the release notes personally.

126
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,160
And then we'll click Finish.

127
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,430
So you'll probably see, hopefully see a prompt that looks something like this.

128
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,470
Your name will be different.

129
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,460
And I just full screened it to make it hopefully legible.

130
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,760
And for now, the last thing we'll do just to verify that git is installed is run the command, get

131
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,470
dash dash version.

132
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,540
So as long as we see something here, you should see something here.

133
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,560
If you have this if you're able to see this window after the installation, then I can't think of a

134
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,330
situation where it would not be installed.

135
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:15,140
But just to verify we can run this get dash dash version, the command is being recognized and we should

136
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,980
be good to go.

137
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,350
Now, one thing I'll mention is if you do close out of this, you get rid of this terminal window.

138
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:29,350
If we shut that down, if you want to reopen it and have access to it again, a pretty reasonable request.

139
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,370
You can just search for a get bash.

140
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,179
That's the name of the application we want to run or open.

141
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,510
So get bash and then we get back to this window.

142
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,059
So if you're on a Windows machine, this window is where you will be working.

143
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:49,700
When you see me working on my Mac terminal, I'll talk about some of the minor differences in commands,

144
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,390
but overall it should be a pretty smooth experience now that we have it installed.
