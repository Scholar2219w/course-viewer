1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,600
Okay.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,860
So one other tool I recommend you install.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,250
Definitely not necessary to use gids, but I am going to use it throughout the course to illustrate

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,410
and to help visualise what's happening at times is a guy we called get crackin.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,180
So as I mentioned earlier, there are lots of options for graphical user interfaces.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:27,270
GIs for Git Get Crackin is a great free one that I think looks pretty nice here it is in action so I've

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,800
already installed it on my Mac.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,870
It's a single click to download it and then there's an installer, so I'll demonstrate that, but I

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,160
think it looks pretty good.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,970
It's just a nice tool to help us visualize what's happening here.

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,670
All this history and these weird branches and merging things and stuff we haven't covered at all, of

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,920
course that we will soon.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,100
And then we can compare and see changes between files, see if I can demonstrate some of that anyway.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,300
It's just a nice tool.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,110
It's free.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,650
There is a paid version that includes some other features, but the bulk of what we need or everything

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,640
we need is free.

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,960
So click on the link in the description or the resource I've included.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,000
Get crack and download for free and then follow the instructions.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,100
So I'm doing this on my windows side.

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,650
It's hard to tell maybe, but I'm on windows and I'm going to wait for that to finish up.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,170
Oh, did we open it?

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,540
If you're on the Mac or on a mac, do the same thing.

24
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,320
Of course.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,550
Open the file.

26
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,390
Are you opening?

27
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,500
Here it is.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,760
It's installing.

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,620
And let's see you get this cute animation of a squid.

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,640
So it does prompt us for an email and a password.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,850
This is not tied to get itself.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,790
It's asking you to make a git crack account or if you happen to have a github account already, this

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,140
will be the easiest option.

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,200
But I don't have I do have a GitHub account, but just to simulate the fact that I don't on this machine,

35
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,170
on my windows side, I could create a get crackin account.

36
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,780
I've got to just put in a name and an email so I'll just do Colt and then, I don't know, Colt at gmail.com.

37
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,180
Not my real email.

38
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,750
I'll do it.

39
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,890
Silly password.

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,330
Purple.

41
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,710
Horrible password.

42
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:11,990
It's even.

43
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,770
Let me do that.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,090
Okay.

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,210
How about purple?

46
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,130
Green.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,690
All right.

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,380
I've read and I've agreed.

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,060
Okay.

50
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,270
Now, of course, if you're not comfortable signing up for another account, another service, well,

51
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,740
you're going to need GitHub through the course.

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,300
So I recommend just registering for that anyway.

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,900
Otherwise, we'll run into some issues down the line.

54
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,750
But there are alternative GIs.

55
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,190
I'm using this not as an integral part of the course that you have to follow along with, but more as

56
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,090
a tool to help teach and help illustrate things.

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,340
It's just much more visual and hopefully more engaging.

58
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,450
Okay, so then it's asking me to put a name and email in here.

59
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,270
I always make sure this matches what I've configured.

60
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,480
Get with what we did just a little while ago.

61
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,350
So we configured.

62
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,240
Get to have a name and an email.

63
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,520
I would do the same thing, so same name and same email, but it also here will actually update your

64
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,310
get config if you want it to update from here.

65
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,120
Anyway, this is not a big deal, so I would just make them match.

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,070
So I'll do what I did earlier.

67
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,100
Called at gmail dot co.

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,180
Okay.

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,750
Save changes, and now I'm in and we don't really have anything to do yet.

70
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,970
But you should see something like this.

71
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,780
And eventually, once we start working, we'll see something more like this.

72
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,740
So I believe the Windows and Mac versions are very, very similar.

73
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,760
I have both of them open here, although I don't have a repository open over here.

74
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,650
The UI I think is identical.

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,500
If there are any changes, I'll do my best to point them out.

76
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,870
All right, so we have get cracking and now let's get cracking on the rest of the course.
