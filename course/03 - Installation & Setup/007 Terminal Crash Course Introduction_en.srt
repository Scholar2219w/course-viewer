1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,870
Okay.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,430
So this is an optional crash course on basic Unix commands.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,620
If you are familiar with these commands, I'll run through them very quickly.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:20,550
Things like LHS and P and CD and touch and mkdir make dear make dir r m our m dash ref.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,410
If you know those commands already or you're familiar enough with them, then I would just skip the

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,400
next three videos.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,560
Right?

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,980
You can always come back to these.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,850
They have nothing to do with Git on their own, but they play a very important role.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,550
And if you are not familiar with them, if you're new to the terminal when 100% stick it out through

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,800
these videos, I know it's not the most exciting thing on earth, but let's be honest, neither is Git.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,620
It's very important, but it's not the sexiest topic.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,160
So the reason this all matters is that I will be teaching git primarily from the command line, so I'll

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,030
be doing things like just as an example.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,510
Everyone, I'm going to move into this folder here.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,890
And to do that I would use the CD command, which we have not yet discussed.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:13,320
And then and here I'd like to make a new file called my Apks JS file and then we'll run some git command

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,500
in here, do some git stuff again.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,990
Haven't talked about any of this, but I'll do things like that and then we'll run another command and

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,400
then we'll back out.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,590
The point is that we'll be navigating through the terminal, moving to different locations, different

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,350
folders, manipulating files, making changes, deleting creating things, and then interacting with

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:34,890
git.

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,380
From here we'll run commands that are specific to get and the folder that we're in.

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,780
So if you are comfortable with those basic commands, if already laid out, skip the next few videos.

26
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,570
If you're not if you're not familiar, don't freak out.

27
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,090
This is stuff that it's easy but it's it takes a bit of time for it to really stick.

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,340
The hardest part is remembering the commands.

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,740
So I recommend you just put some sticky notes up or a cheat sheet just to come back to these commands.

30
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,110
No one's expecting you to know them by heart.

31
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,960
After three videos, it takes a while for my bootcamp students in person at least to start working with

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,990
these commands like they're second nature because they're not.

33
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,580
It's kind of a horrible interface, but you force yourself to use it and you'll get comfortable.

34
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,020
Last thing I'll say is if you're on a mac, I'll be using the terminal app.

35
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,210
And if you're using a Windows machine as we installed Git, we set up get bash.

36
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,120
So my screen will look like this on the windows side.

37
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,130
Either one, the commands are 99.9% identical.

38
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,830
So if you see me do a command like LRS on the windows side or on the Mac side, they both are going

39
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,060
to do the same thing.

40
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:42,960
All right.

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,070
So let's get started.

42
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,240
Remember, completely optional, but I highly recommend sticking it out through these videos.

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,890
If you don't know the terminal commands, if you don't know the basic UNIX commands that I quickly ran

44
00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:00,150
through c d touch make directory, rem, lz d those are going to be pretty important for the rest of

45
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,340
the course so that we can work with Git.

46
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,210
All right, I'll shut up.

47
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,170
Let's get started.
