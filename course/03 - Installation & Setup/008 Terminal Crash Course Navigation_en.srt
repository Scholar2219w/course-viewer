1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,640
So in this video, I'm going to run through some of the essential terminal commands for navigation for

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,800
moving around on your machine.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,960
We need this in order to work with Git.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,340
If you already know these commands, things like LZ and WD and CD, if you know those commands, feel

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,810
free to skip this, of course.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,690
But if you don't, I'm going to run through this quickly.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,180
But also I recommend you take some time to practice and just keep a reference or a cheat sheet up that

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,410
you can look back at because I'll be using a lot of these commands throughout the course, but nothing

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,880
super difficult, I promise.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,680
The hardest part is just remembering them.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,800
Okay, so I've got my Mac window here.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,650
I've got my terminal open, just the terminal app on Mac.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,860
So if you're following along with a mac, you'll look at this screen.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,650
And then occasionally when there is a small deviation or difference on a windows machine, here is my

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,850
windows terminal.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,120
This is the bash or bash shell that I've opened up.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,990
So if you installed that on a Windows machine, it will look something like this.

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:04,590
So the first command we'll talk about is called LS It is short for list list the contents of a folder

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,450
or of the current directory.

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,990
So if you type ls into your terminal and you hit enter wherever you currently are and we haven't learned

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,760
how to move yet, so we'll talk about where we currently are, wherever that location is, we will see

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,230
the contents printed out.

24
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,190
So in this case I'm in a folder that contains some JavaScript files.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,440
HTML file, a CSS file, a llamas python file a folder called Secret.

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,080
That is what's printed out, at least in this slide.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,710
So if I try it over here, this is a brand new terminal window.

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,760
I just made a new tab.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,720
I haven't moved.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,370
I haven't talked about moving.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,290
Where am I?

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,460
Well, I'm at a location called the Home Directory and it's abbreviated or it's symbolized by this tilde

33
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,240
character.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,300
You can find that above a tab key on most keyboards.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,200
Anyway, my home directory contains a lot of a lot of things.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,980
If I hit LRS, you won't see all of these.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,490
Some of them are standard on a mac like applications, desktop documents, downloads, public pictures.

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,790
Some of them are my folders I've made, like, you know, get demo and get stuff.

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,080
What else?

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Pets.

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,300
Terminal demo.

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,290
Those are my folders I've made.

43
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,190
Anyway, you'll see something, right?

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,870
You'll see contents of your home directory.

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,840
And if you're on a Windows machine, we can do the same thing you can get.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,110
BASH So, LZ, now I see different things because there are different files and folders on a Windows

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,000
machine, but I'm in the same location on this Windows machine.

48
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,590
TILDE That is my home directory.

49
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,470
All right, so we can't move right now.

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,270
We're just simply looking at files and folders in one location.

51
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,960
And I'm going to show you a command that I don't have a slide for on a mac.

52
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,250
The command is open.

53
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,190
If we type open dot, it's actually going to open up in Finder on a mac.

54
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,600
The file explorer is called Finder, the same directory where I currently am.

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,520
So this is my home directory.

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,350
And if you've never used a terminal, you're probably familiar with this sort of navigation, right?

57
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,950
If I want to look at my courses folder, I double click.

58
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,100
If I want to go back, I click the back arrow.

59
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,450
That's kind of the basic navigation without the terminal.

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,260
Now if I'm on a Windows machine, the open command actually does not work.

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,100
It tells me command not found, but instead I can do start dot.

62
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,010
This is really the one major difference I can think of so far.

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,220
And then this opens up the windows equivalent of finder.

64
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,720
I think it's called file.

65
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,070
Is it file explorer?

66
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,750
I'm not much of a Windows user anyway.

67
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,850
Probably shouldn't admit that you can see the folders and files that are listed here.

68
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,070
So we've got pictures as an example.

69
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,290
And if I do start Dot, I can see.

70
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,820
All right, here's the pictures folder.

71
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,330
We have videos, there's a videos folder there.

72
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,200
So all of those things that we see represented here are also here.

73
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,700
It's just two different ways of interacting or viewing the contents of this folder.

74
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,900
All right.

75
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,090
So that's LZ on its own.

76
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,650
Just LZ, nothing.

77
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,850
Afterwards you hit enter and it shows us what is in the current directory.

78
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,940
But I can also use LZ on a folder.

79
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:22,360
So I could say, you know, what's inside this pets folder and all I need to do is reference the path.

80
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,790
So the name in this case is pets.

81
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,140
So, LZ, pets.

82
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,580
And that's what's inside that pets folder.

83
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,020
And I can actually open that folder, too, if I just do open pets.

84
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,180
And it opened on my other screen.

85
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,170
Let me drag this up.

86
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,820
There we are.

87
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,040
You can see those contents.

88
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,970
Cats, chickens, hamsters and so on.

89
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,140
All right.

90
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
I'll do that on a Windows machine as well.

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,470
Let's say I want to know what is inside of this git course directory so I can do ls get and I need to

92
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,930
spell it correctly, but I can also hit tab to autocomplete and it looks like it's an empty directory.

93
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,800
Well, that's my fault for picking that one.

94
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,930
Let's try another one.

95
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,250
How about what is in git stuff?

96
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,250
I don't know.

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,110
I don't remember making that.

98
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,890
But we'll try.

99
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,540
LS get stuff.

100
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,640
Okay.

101
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,580
There's one folder called Demo.

102
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,670
Not very exciting, but hopefully you get the idea here.

103
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,310
We can use RLS with nothing afterwards.

104
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,440
Also there's a command called the clear.

105
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll just show because I'll be using.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
This kind of annoys me when I have a lot of stuff in my terminal, so that goes away.

107
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,350
So that has nothing to do with navigation.

108
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,740
So as I was saying LZ on its own, we'll list the contents of our current directory.

109
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,470
LS Followed by the name of a directory like I could do pets as I've shown you.

110
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,530
I see the files in pets.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,320
It's a bunch of folders, actually.

112
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,240
And if I wanted to look at, let's say, the goats directory or how about the cats directory?

113
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,640
I can't do LZ cats because there is no cats directory where I currently am.

114
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,680
Remember, this is what I see.

115
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,520
I currently am viewing or I'm inside this home directory.

116
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,170
That's what I see when I type ls.

117
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,960
I have to type out the path to access cats.

118
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,540
It's inside of pets.

119
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,200
So it's actually this ls pets slash cats.

120
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,850
And there we are.

121
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,840
It's one of my cats.

122
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,600
Her name is Blue Blue Steel and that's all I'll show you with RLS.

123
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,640
We can reference these paths where we chain things together.

124
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,450
Anyway, the next command I'll show you is pretty simple.

125
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,710
It's called P wd for print working directory.

126
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,440
And what this will do, it's very simple.

127
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,650
It just prints out your current location.

128
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,870
It prints out the path to where you currently are.

129
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,860
So we haven't been able to move, right?

130
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,980
We haven't changed locations yet.

131
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:50,350
We've been able to like peek into other folders with LLS, but p wd is if I just type it like that,

132
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,640
it's going to give me the exact location where I am right now.

133
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,350
So the home directory here is just short.

134
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,160
That little utility is a short way of referencing this location.

135
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,650
My user on here is called Cold Steel.

136
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,540
That is where I currently am.

137
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,370
But if I'm on my windows machine, it's going to be it's quite different.

138
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,780
It's similar, but it's different because on a Windows machine we've got this C drive, right?

139
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:18,550
So see slash users slash Colt Steel and that's obviously going to be your username.

140
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,650
So probably not Colt Steel.

141
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,160
So that is where we currently are.

142
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,840
If I type DWD, that's my location.

143
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,720
And that brings me to our next command, which is CD for Change Directory.

144
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,630
This is how we move around.

145
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:38,720
It's the equivalent if I do open, it's the equivalent of double clicking on one of these things, right?

146
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,180
And moving between folders.

147
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm now in a different folder you can think of.

148
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,460
This is my current directory.

149
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:50,440
Now if I click here, this is my current directory and if I click in pictures, that's my current directory.

150
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,500
And there's one of my chickens, Stevie Chicks.

151
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,170
All right.

152
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,570
So if I want to change directories from the terminal, which I'll be doing all the time in the course,

153
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,310
I use CD followed by the directory that I'm trying to change into.

154
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,240
So I often use LZ first.

155
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,420
What do we have?

156
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,740
Let's go into this code directory.

157
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,510
You probably don't have that, but you could pick any other folder of yours and CD into it.

158
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,060
So CD code.

159
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,590
All right, so my prompt changes.

160
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,480
It tells me I'm in the code folder.

161
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,460
Your prompt will look different, but it should.

162
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,190
It likely will reveal to you where you are.

163
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,110
But if not, you can always type.

164
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,390
And we see, oh, now I'm in users code style slash code.

165
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:42,110
So just to illustrate this, if I were to open the current folder, now I'm in the code folder, not

166
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,370
the home directory, and I can continue to move.

167
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,450
But first if I type LHS.

168
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,200
Now we see completely different contents.

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,600
A lot of stuff in this code folder.

170
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,360
This is from one of my other courses and I could take a look at any of these other locations.

171
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,340
How about CSIS?

172
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,850
Intro for CSIS intro?

173
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,450
So CD oh four and I'm just going to hit tab to Autocomplete for me.

174
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,820
And if I seed into that, I type if I can spell it.

175
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,340
Notice my working directory, my current location has changed and if I type ls we now see the contents

176
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,360
and if I open?

177
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,220
This is what we're looking at in Finder.

178
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,160
Text Properties, CSS intro and then a zip file right there.

179
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,410
Same thing on a windows machine if I pick some folder to CD into.

180
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,760
How about.

181
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,200
I don't really know.

182
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,100
I don't have much on here, but let's go into desktop.

183
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,430
Maybe.

184
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,570
I'm not sure if it's on there.

185
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,850
So CD desktop and I'm going to clear.

186
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,350
And now if I type my working directory, my location has changed.

187
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,980
I'm now on my home directory.

188
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,890
See slash user slash called steal on a windows machine slash desktop if I type ls.

189
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,510
Oh, there's nothing on here.

190
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,800
Well, that's underwhelming.

191
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:13,270
And that actually leads me to my next command, which is a variation of CD, CD, followed by two dots.

192
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,030
This is how we move backwards.

193
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,850
So remember I showed you this example in Finder?

194
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:25,290
If I open this up, if I want to CD into this CD, if I want to double click in and then I decide I

195
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,570
want to go back, I just click the back arrow.

196
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:35,610
But using CD, what we actually can do is CD, dot, dot, and this will take us back one level, one

197
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,920
folder, so we back up.

198
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,550
So currently I'm in this CSS intro folder.

199
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,680
This is what's inside of it.

200
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,490
If I do CD Dot, dot and I type P CD.

201
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,520
This is where I am now.

202
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,200
That's where I was before.

203
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,370
I'm now one level back right here and I could do it again.

204
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,080
CD Dot, dot first.

205
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,560
Let me just show you the contents.

206
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,810
All that stuff.

207
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,090
CD Dot, dot.

208
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,820
Now I'm back in my home directory.

209
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,510
So same thing over here.

210
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,970
I'm in the desktop.

211
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm on the desktop.

212
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,280
There's nothing to look at.

213
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,210
It's empty.

214
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,680
CD Dot, dot.

215
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,540
And now I'm in my home directory.

216
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,070
So that's the very basics of navigation.

217
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:23,340
We'll get more practice in the next video as we talk more about some other commands, like making folders

218
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,740
and files and deleting folders and files.

219
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,410
Along with those commands we still need to use CD and LS all the time.

220
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,270
So you'll get practice if you're new to this.

221
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:39,840
But also keep in mind you're not going to just memorize it and become a terminal genius overnight.

222
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,190
It takes time and it feels a little bit clunky when you're starting out.

223
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,940
You don't need to feel like an expert before you move on to learn git.

224
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,460
Just make a cheat sheet some sticky notes to remind yourself of the five or six commands that we cover

225
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,550
and stick them on your computer and just look at that if needed.

226
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,670
Anyway, that's the basics of navigation we covered.

227
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:07,950
LS for list for print, working directory and CD for change directory cd dot dot backs out one folder.

228
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,350
And the other thing we did was open.

229
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,020
Open Dot will open a folder.

230
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,500
The current folder that we're looking at and on a windows machine it start dot.
