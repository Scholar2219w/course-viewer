1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,520
Okay.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,090
So let's talk about installing Git on a mac.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,040
Most Macs these days actually come with get pre installed and normally that will work fine.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,730
However, this course is actually using some of the newer features in get some new syntax that older

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,170
versions don't contain.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:24,290
So you want to make sure that you're using get 2.23, 2.23, 2.2, three and above.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,260
And the easiest way to do that is to open up a terminal app.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,900
I'll just be using throughout this course the built in terminal utility on a mac.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,180
So it's in applications, utilities, terminal, but I usually just search for it.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,210
And honestly, it's pretty much always open on my machine.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,020
All right.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,480
So the command that we'll run to check our version is get dash dash version.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,010
So I see 2.2, 4.3.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,990
I really don't need to upgrade or update, but just to show you how to go through with it.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,709
If you go to the git documentation, the link I've included as a resource with this video and you click

16
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,720
download, it will detect if you're on a mac.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,300
Download the latest version for Mac.

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,410
So it looks like there's there's different types of releases.

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,520
We're going to click this one here not the source release but the release it suggesting for Mac.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,130
Okay.

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,600
And so nothing is going to start installing just yet.

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,180
But what we're going to do next is click on binary installer and you really don't need to worry about

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,730
this and panic if things aren't going great.

24
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:36,720
Remember, you already have get installed and if you already have something above 2.23, then I wouldn't

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,530
stress about it.

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,690
The differences are all very, very minor.

27
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,190
Probably have nothing to do with the videos in this course, but I'm going to just show you how to do

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,460
this.

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,950
So we're going to click this link where it says Tim Harper provides an installer for Get OC, and then

30
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,140
we're going to select the latest version here, which for me is 2.27.

31
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,340
And then we just wait for it to download.

32
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,400
So there it is and then we'll have to open that up.

33
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,660
Here we are.

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,210
We just double click on the package and then I'm going to have to go into my system preferences and

35
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,750
say, No, no, it's okay, don't worry about this.

36
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:17,060
So I'll go into the security and privacy tab of my system preferences and then I'm going to click open

37
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,750
anyway.

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,350
And then I'm going to click open.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,410
Okay.

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,380
Now we make it to the installer.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
Continue install.

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,860
Password or fingerprint, depending on your Mac.

43
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,020
And we'll wait a little bit.

44
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,350
All right.

45
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,290
It says installation was successful.

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,710
We'll move it to the trash.

47
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,790
All right, so it may seem like our version has not changed.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,890
I run get dash dash version again in my terminal.

49
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,070
It still says 2.2 to 4.3.

50
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,060
But if I open a new window or even just a new tab, this is a new tab.

51
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,440
If I run the same command we now see we actually have the latest version.

52
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,830
So you just need to open a new window, a new tab you can verify.

53
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,460
Don't worry.

54
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,170
If you don't have exactly 2.27, just aim to have greater than 2.23.

55
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,610
And even if you don't, the differences really will only come up with one or two commands.

56
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,860
But it's pretty easy to install.

57
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,110
Hopefully you don't run into any major issues and if you do, we have to of course to help you out.

58
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,460
But really it's just a package you install.

59
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,720
The most annoying part these days in a mac is clicking all of the security system preferences stuff.

60
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,770
All right, so we now have git installed.

61
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,740
Next up, I'm going to talk about something called get crackin.
