1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,690
Okay.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,280
So now that we have installed Git, whether you're on a mac or a Windows machine, the next thing we

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,740
need to do is configure our name and email.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,860
So we need to tell Git who we are, who it should attribute work to on our machine.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,350
So this is not tied to an account necessarily.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,520
There's no password.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,110
You can make this whatever you want.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,060
But let me just demonstrate the significance of setting up our name.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,630
So if I'm working on a project with a bunch of people, for example, this is a project I have I really

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,280
haven't done anything sort of faking it.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,090
It's, it's React, which is a very large JavaScript library.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,310
I'm going to just run a quick command here and what you're looking at right now, full screen.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:48,180
This is a log of different work, different check points on this application and who did them.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,850
So here's one made by me, Colt Steel, but I can go back and see.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,680
Here's some other work done by someone named Andrew Clark and somebody else did some other work.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,070
Here's more.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,940
Andrew Clark.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,560
Here's Brian Vaughn.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,820
So the point here is that so here's Dan Abramoff, pretty famous developer.

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,790
Anyway, the idea is that Git knows who did what work and who is making these checkpoints and these

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,420
changes.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,070
So we need to configure that.

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,330
So this does not have to match some account that you have somewhere else.

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,950
However, I recommend that you use the name that you want to be known by as a developer.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,690
If you are going to publish your work and put it up on GitHub, you want to use a name that people know

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,880
you buy or that will be consistent.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,770
You don't want to be changing this all the time.

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,090
And then your email.

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,620
I recommend configuring with the email that you'll set up for your GitHub account if you haven't done

30
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,540
so well ready later in the course.

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,640
When we talk about GitHub, we can cross that bridge and you can always reconfigure these two values.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,870
So here's how we do it.

33
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,450
The first step we'll do our name.

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,680
So all we do is get config and then dash dash global.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,550
That's a way of telling git to set our username or our user name to be the same name across every time

36
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,020
we use git every instance.

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,370
But you can always change this.

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:08,460
So get config global username and then in quotes the name you want get to know you by.

39
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,199
So I can try this right now.

40
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,220
I'm not going to configure it.

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,240
I want to show you.

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,920
I can actually just check.

43
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,130
Do you have a user name for me already get?

44
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,290
If I run this command, I'm not setting it.

45
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm asking and it says Yep, you're cold steel.

46
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:31,920
However, on my windows side if I do get config username I haven't configured one so it shows me nothing.

47
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,630
So I'm going to set that now.

48
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,090
So get config dash dash global username and then in quotes the name I want.

49
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,450
So get config dash dash global user name and I'll do cold steel.

50
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,790
Obviously you should put your name there.

51
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,900
I'm going to hit enter.

52
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,910
We don't really see anything happen, but now if I try and retrieve it, that's what this line does

53
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,430
get what is username?

54
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,090
It tells me cold steel and we're good to go now.

55
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,970
We're going to do the same thing for email, so it's the exact same pattern except user email and then

56
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,710
provide your email address.

57
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,600
So we'll try this.

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,070
It's the same process.

59
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,050
I'll do this on the Windows side, but whatever platform you're on, you want to do this, we'll do

60
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,630
get config user email.

61
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,770
Nothing is there.

62
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:28,140
But now I'm going to say get config dash dash global user email and then set it to be this is not my

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,270
real email but cult at gmail dot co.

64
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,590
Again, not my real email, but I recommend you put an email you have access to and especially when

65
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,030
we sign up for a GitHub account.

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,210
If you can foresee the email you would use for GitHub, I would use that email now, but we can always

67
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:45,730
change it.

68
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,730
It's the exact same line to change it.

69
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,210
So now I can recall the line from earlier.

70
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,610
If you don't know how to do this, hit the up arrow.

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,110
I can scroll through different lines up and down and I'm just going to verify.

72
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,130
Did it set?

73
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,000
And it did.

74
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,520
OC So that's all we needed to do.

75
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,610
Those two lines are going to tell Git who we are so that for future work, when we make changes, they

76
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,080
are attributed to whatever that user name and user dot email are set to.

77
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:13,800
All right.
