1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,380
So this section is all oriented around installation and setup.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,980
Nothing very glamorous, but a lot of critical content that will need to move forward.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,920
So the first thing we cover are the two main ways of using Git from the command line and from graphical

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,060
user interfaces.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,610
That isn't a very important distinction to understand.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,800
We'll be playing around with both throughout the course and then we focus on installing Git.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,310
So I have separate instructions for Mac versus Windows users.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,980
That's definitely going to be critical.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,940
I marked it as yellow just because it can take a little bit of time.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,980
If you're on a Windows machine, it's not hard.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,680
You just have to change some settings and watch the video.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,910
You'll see we just click a bunch of times and hit next and then hit next and then hit next.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,500
But obviously very critical.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,020
We also install an application called Get Crackin.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,530
It's a game.

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,330
We forget it's free.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,370
I guess it's not critical.

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,840
You don't have to use it if you want to use Git, but I'm going to put it as important slash critical

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,260
because for this course we'll be using this, but it is not critical to get itself configuring your

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,500
git name and email, critical but also very quick and easy.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,810
And then the biggest question mark in this section is the terminal crash course videos.

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,490
There are three videos at the end of this section that are absolutely critical.

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,990
If you have no experience working with terminal command, basic UNIX, Unix commands like LHS and CD

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,950
and Touch.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,630
So if you're familiar with those, you can skip those videos and they're not critical.

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,570
They're not really get specific at all.

27
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,500
So if you have experience, you can skip those, but it's all new to you.

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,230
I 100% would sit through them.

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,050
You don't need to take notes, but practice along with those videos.

30
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,640
They are very important.

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,100
If you want to be able to use get down the line.

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,440
We have to be able to navigate through the terminal.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,650
So most things in this section are critical, but no big concepts.

34
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,580
It's just installation plus this weird thing at the end with the terminal.

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,800
I highly recommend checking that out if you're new.
