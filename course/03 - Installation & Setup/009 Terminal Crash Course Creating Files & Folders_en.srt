1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,540
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,450
So the next group of commands I'm going to show you have to do with file and folder creation as well

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,730
as deletion or destruction.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,160
So we've seen how to navigate around.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,860
But another really important piece is being able to make new files.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,130
So normally the way we would make a new file without the terminal would probably involve opening up

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,810
some application.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,710
Like I use VS code, I have it open Visual Studio code and then I could go file new or just command

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,490
n and then start making a file, whatever type of file this is.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,800
Let's say it's a JavaScript file.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,780
I can put some JavaScript in it.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,740
Hello.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,370
It doesn't matter if you don't know JavaScript and then I can save this file and then I pick a destination.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:44,760
Right.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,040
And I give it a name like app JS with a dot JS extension and then I select somewhere for that to go.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,280
That's the typical workflow for creating a new file.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,610
If you're not doing it from a text editor or from some whatever, Excel or Photoshop or something,

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,150
you open an application and you create a file in the application.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,630
But instead we can use a command called Touch Touch to Use.

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,350
It doesn't actually stand for anything like the other commands where we have CD is changed.

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,810
Directory touch is just touch.

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,760
It has a secondary use.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,190
We're not really going to go into where you can touch a file that already exists and you're simply updating

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,300
the modified time.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,150
It really doesn't matter for now if it helps.

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,240
Just think of it as a very weird name because it is very odd.

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,340
If I were designing it, there'd be a command called, I don't know, create or make or something.

28
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,470
Anyway, so all that we need to do is run, touch and then a space and then a file name or multiple

29
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,730
that we want to create.

30
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,250
And when we hit enter, wherever we currently are, whatever directory we're in, there will now be

31
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,550
a file in this case called Purple Text.

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,520
So I'll demonstrate this, I'll clear.

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,180
And I'm currently in my home directory so I can just make a file right here if I want to.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,800
Why don't I open finder just so you have it, so you can see it over there?

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,700
I know it's not.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,230
It's not that easy to read.

37
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,840
Unfortunately, this is the largest I can make these icons.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,160
But you're not missing much.

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,420
Anyway, over here, I'm going to create a file.

40
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,650
What should we call this one?

41
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,460
How about Purple Dot?

42
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,940
JS So it's a JavaScript file called Purple.

43
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,730
So we don't really see anything changed.

44
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:41,040
But if I type LZ now we see a file that's been created and over here in my finder window I can see purple

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,210
JS so I can also make multiple at once.

46
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,940
I could do red text for a text file and orange.

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,150
What's another dot pi for a python file?

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,250
I could even make a PDF file.

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,620
These are all going to be completely empty.

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,610
Just an empty shell of a file with a name and an extension.

51
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,030
So what can I do?

52
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,720
Yellow dot pdf that just made me three files in one go.

53
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,190
Red, orange and yellow.

54
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:18,660
I can see them here if I run LZ or I can see them over here by inspecting them with my eyes.

55
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,940
I guess navigating.

56
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,780
I can see them purple, orange, red and yellow.

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,890
PDF.

58
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,840
It is a true pdf file.

59
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,270
My Mac is displaying the PDF icon.

60
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,740
I can do the same thing of course over here on my windows side.

61
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,910
Let's see.

62
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,510
We're just.

63
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:36,990
Whoops.

64
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,650
LS we're in the home directory, so I could make a file.

65
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,310
Here, let me clear this touch.

66
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,120
How about magenta dot txt?

67
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,590
If I type LZ, that will show up right there.

68
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,190
And if I go to the file explorer start.

69
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,890
Here it is magenta and it's a totally empty file.

70
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,300
And I could open it from here.

71
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,740
Select what to open it with.

72
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,940
Sure, notepad.

73
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,920
And then I can start working on it.

74
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,940
But I don't have anything to work on, so I'm just going to ignore that.

75
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,090
So that's the basic concept of touch.

76
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:21,050
The next thing I want to show you is how we can make new folders so touches, how we make new files.

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,570
We can make as many as we want in a single go.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,610
Just separate the names by spaces.

79
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,350
Specify an extension.

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,540
And those files will be created in your current directory.

81
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,060
So I guess I should illustrate.

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,610
If I change directories into something else, for example, uh, what should I do?

83
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,240
Let's go on the window side.

84
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,090
I don't have anything on my desktop.

85
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,570
If I seed into desktop, I type LHS.

86
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,590
There's nothing there.

87
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:53,090
But if I touch a file, how about touch cyan dot js?

88
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,380
Now I have a file on my desktop and I'm sure I could show that to you.

89
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,500
Here it is the only file on my desktop.

90
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:08,010
So where I am when I run this command touch, that is where the file will be created.

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,800
Although you can actually create a file somewhere else that you're currently not inside.

92
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,640
For example, I could create a file instead of pets.

93
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,580
I am not in the pets directory.

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,620
All I need to do is touch and then the path to get to pets.

95
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,500
From where I am, I am in this folder so I would reference pets, which is somewhere here.

96
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,790
Where are you?

97
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,050
Here it is.

98
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,920
And then maybe inside of horses.

99
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,530
I could create a file so I could do touch pets.

100
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,910
Slash horses.

101
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,960
Slash.

102
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,850
How about Rocky Dot?

103
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,230
I don't know.

104
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:49,740
A PNG file which you normally wouldn't create an empty PNG, but there we go and we see it created over

105
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,270
here.

106
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,520
I'm not going to see it in my home directory.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,350
It's not here.

108
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,130
I could seed into pets.

109
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,710
I still won't see it.

110
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,810
I could seed into horses and now I see it.

111
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,260
All right, so that's the basics of making files.

112
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,700
You can make them in a different location as long as you reference the correct path from where you are,

113
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,870
or you just make them in the current location where you are, whatever you see when you type.

114
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,490
If you try and create a new file with touch, dot, text or whatever the file is, you're creating it

115
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,690
in this location.

116
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,790
And there you are.

117
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,250
There's our second horse, good old Rocky, and asked your architect.

118
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,680
The next thing we need to know how to do is make folders.

119
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,340
So to make a directory the command is make dear or make dir.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,200
I guess.

121
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,290
I guess you pronounce it directory.

122
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,260
So make dir.

123
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,110
I always say make dear in my head.

124
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,860
It doesn't matter.

125
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,330
MGK d i r.

126
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,740
So this command you follow it up with the name of directory you want to create.

127
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,270
It works in the same way as touch.

128
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,610
You can pass in multiple, separate them by spaces and by default they'll be created in your current

129
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,920
location, in your working directory.

130
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,000
So let's go to the pets directory right now.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,230
I'm in this horses directory, so I'm going to back out and I want to make a new type of pet in this

132
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,100
directory.

133
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,350
So what should I do?

134
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,760
Frogs.

135
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,020
How about turtles?

136
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,910
So we'll make a new directory.

137
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,950
So not touch, but dear turtles and it doesn't have to be capitalized.

138
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,890
I'm just doing that because all these other directories are.

139
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,670
And if I show you over here, there's no turtles folder.

140
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,180
But now there is and it's empty.

141
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:40,140
So if I type ls I see turtles, I can see into turtles I can create a file in here.

142
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,060
What's a famous turtle?

143
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,580
I guess there's Lonesome George, who technically is a tortoise, but we'll make a file for him.

144
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,930
How about a Python file?

145
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,700
Great.

146
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,400
And then I could even make another folder in here, which I call this folder instead of turtles.

147
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,990
Let's make two directories.

148
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,630
How about sea turtles?

149
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,000
And this is actually an important note.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,540
You don't want to put spaces in your names of files.

151
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,930
We want to, especially if we're using make directory.

152
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,960
It's going to think this is two directories we want to make.

153
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,550
See Space Turtles.

154
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,030
If you really wanted a space, you could do this with quotes.

155
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,130
But I don't recommend having spaces in there.

156
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,480
It just causes problems.

157
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,640
So do sea turtles.

158
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,010
Sea turtles like this sea underscore turtles.

159
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,850
It doesn't matter.

160
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,100
So I'll make a directory for sea turtles and then we'll just call them land turtles.

161
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,049
Sure.

162
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,650
I don't think that's the right term, actually, but here we are.

163
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,010
I now have two directories and a file inside of turtles.

164
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,980
So two empty folders I just made and then I can fill out their contents.

165
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,040
So let's make directory.

166
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,170
You just pass in a name.

167
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,610
I'll quickly demonstrate this on a Windows machine.

168
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,910
I'm on the desktop.

169
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,550
I'll make a folder here mkdir.

170
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,550
How about I don't know, cars?

171
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,950
And I'll do two at a time.

172
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,780
Cars and bikes.

173
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,870
And then if I want to view them, I could do LZ.

174
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,100
I see them right.

175
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,770
And they are visually represented differently, a different color, and then also a slash after their

176
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,220
name.

177
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,790
But I could also view my desktop and then I see the two empty folders plus my cyan file.

178
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,960
So that is make directory as well as touch.

179
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,270
Those are the two commands we saw in this video.

180
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,680
Just remember that they run relative to where you are.

181
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,900
So if you want to make a file in some folder, it's easiest if you navigate to that folder and you can

182
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,420
make 100 files at once using touch and then open up an editor or something to actually work on those

183
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,080
files.

184
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:43,970
Okay.

185
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,760
So next up, the last piece we're going to talk about deleting stuff.
